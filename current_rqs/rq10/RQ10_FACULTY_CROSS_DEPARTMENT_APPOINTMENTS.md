# RQ10: Faculty Cross-Department Appointments Analysis

## Research Question
**How many faculty members have appointments (joint or otherwise) with computer science, engineering, or data science departments?**

## Overview
This analysis examines faculty appointments across different department types within universities, specifically focusing on faculty members who have appointments with computer science, engineering, or data science departments. The analysis provides insights into cross-department faculty distribution, multiple appointment patterns, and the integration of technology-focused departments with broader academic structures.

## Methodology

### Data Source
- **Primary Database**: Neo4j Graph Database (KG-Perseus)
- **Key Entities**: Faculty, Department, University, Technology, ResearchArea
- **Key Relationships**: `[:APPOINTED_TO]`, `[:HAS]`, `[:USES_TECHNOLOGY]`, `[:HAS_RESEARCH_AREA]`

### Classification Framework
The analysis employs a keyword-based classification system to categorize departments:

1. **Computer Science**: Departments containing keywords like 'computer science', 'cs', 'computing', 'informatics'
2. **Engineering**: Departments containing keywords like 'engineering', 'eng', 'mechanical', 'electrical', 'civil', 'chemical', 'biomedical', 'environmental'
3. **Data Science**: Departments containing keywords like 'data science', 'data', 'analytics', 'statistics', 'biostatistics', 'quantitative'
4. **Other**: All remaining departments

### Analytical Approach
The analysis follows a multi-dimensional approach:

1. **Basic Counts**: Total faculty and appointment counts
2. **Cross-Department Classification**: Faculty distribution by department type
3. **Multiple Appointments**: Faculty with appointments to multiple departments
4. **University-Level Analysis**: Cross-department faculty distribution across institutions
5. **Technology Integration**: Technology usage patterns of cross-department faculty
6. **Research Area Analysis**: Research focus areas of cross-department faculty
7. **Summary Statistics**: Comprehensive overview with percentages
