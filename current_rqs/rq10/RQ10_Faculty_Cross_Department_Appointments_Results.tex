\section{Introduction}

The integration of technology-focused departments within academic institutions has become increasingly important as universities seek to foster interdisciplinary research and prepare students for rapidly evolving technological landscapes. Understanding the distribution and characteristics of faculty appointments across computer science, engineering, and data science departments provides critical insights into institutional capacity for technology-focused education and research.

This analysis addresses Research Question 10: "How many faculty members have appointments (joint or otherwise) with computer science, engineering, or data science departments?" by examining faculty-department relationships, multiple appointment patterns, and technology integration across these key technology domains.

The study leverages a comprehensive knowledge graph database containing faculty, department, university, and technology relationships to provide a multi-dimensional analysis of cross-department faculty appointments. This approach enables identification of interdisciplinary collaboration patterns, institutional strengths, and opportunities for enhanced technology integration in academic programs.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Data Source and Structure}

The analysis utilizes the Knowledge Graph Perseus (KG-Perseus) Neo4j database, which contains comprehensive information about universities, academic programs, faculty members, departments, and technologies. The database structure includes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Faculty Nodes}: Individual faculty members with attributes including name, research areas, and technology expertise
    \item \textbf{Department Nodes}: Academic departments with classification by type and specialization
    \item \textbf{University Nodes}: Higher education institutions with program offerings and infrastructure
    \item \textbf{Technology Nodes}: Technologies and tools used in academic programs and research
    \item \textbf{Research Area Nodes}: Specific research domains and specializations
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Classification Framework}

Faculty appointments were classified using a keyword-based system that categorizes departments into three primary technology domains:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Computer Science}: Departments containing keywords such as 'computer science', 'cs', 'computing', 'informatics', 'software engineering', and 'information technology'
    \item \textbf{Engineering}: Departments containing keywords such as 'engineering', 'eng', 'mechanical', 'electrical', 'civil', 'chemical', 'biomedical', 'environmental', 'industrial', and 'systems engineering'
    \item \textbf{Data Science}: Departments containing keywords such as 'data science', 'data', 'analytics', 'statistics', 'biostatistics', 'quantitative', 'business analytics', and 'information systems'
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Analytical Approach}

The analysis employed a multi-dimensional approach to examine cross-department faculty appointments:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Basic Counts}: Total faculty counts and appointment distribution
    \item \textbf{Cross-Department Classification}: Faculty distribution by department type
    \item \textbf{Multiple Appointment Analysis}: Faculty with appointments to multiple departments
    \item \textbf{University-Level Distribution}: Cross-department faculty distribution across institutions
    \item \textbf{Technology Integration}: Technology usage patterns of cross-department faculty
    \item \textbf{Research Area Mapping}: Research focus areas and interdisciplinary patterns
    \item \textbf{Summary Statistics}: Comprehensive overview with percentages and rankings
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Data Extraction and Processing}

Data extraction utilized Cypher queries to traverse the graph database and identify faculty-department relationships. The queries employed:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{MATCH clauses} to identify faculty-department relationships
    \item \textbf{CASE statements} for department classification
    \item \textbf{OPTIONAL MATCH} for handling potential absence of relationships
    \item \textbf{WHERE clauses} for filtering by department type
    \item \textbf{COLLECT and SIZE functions} for multiple appointment analysis
\end{itemize}
