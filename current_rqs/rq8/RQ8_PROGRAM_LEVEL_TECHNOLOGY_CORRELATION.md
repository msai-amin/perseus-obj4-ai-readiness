# RQ8: Program Level and Type Technology Correlation Analysis

## Research Question
**To what extent are drone/GIS/AI topics correlated with the level (undergraduate, master's, or doctoral) and type of academic programs?**

## Overview
This analysis examines the correlation between technology integration patterns and academic program characteristics, specifically focusing on how drone, GIS, and AI technologies are distributed across different program levels (undergraduate, master's, doctoral) and program types (forestry, natural resources, geospatial, etc.).

## Methodology

### Data Source
- **Primary Database**: Neo4j graph database containing university, program, and technology relationships
- **Data Scope**: Academic programs across 49 universities with forestry and related programs
- **Technology Categories**: AI/ML, GIS, Drones/UAV, Remote Sensing, Data Analytics

### Analysis Framework
The analysis follows a three-dimensional approach:

1. **Program Level Classification**: Undergraduate, Master, Doctoral
2. **Program Type Classification**: Forestry, Natural Resources, Geospatial, Data Science, Engineering, Business/Management, Science, Computer Science, Other
3. **Technology Integration Patterns**: By level, by type, and cross-correlation analysis

### Classification Methodology

#### Program Level Classification
Programs are classified based on keyword analysis of program names:
- **Undergraduate**: bachelor, bs, ba, undergraduate, associate, a.s., a.a.
- **Master**: master, ms, ma, mba, graduate, post-baccalaureate
- **Doctoral**: phd, ph.d., doctorate, doctoral, d.phil
- **Unknown**: Programs that don't match clear level indicators

#### Program Type Classification
Programs are classified based on disciplinary focus:
- **Forestry**: forestry, forest, silviculture
- **Natural Resources**: natural resource, environmental, ecology, conservation
- **Geospatial**: gis, geospatial, geographic, spatial
- **Data Science**: data science, analytics, informatics, computational
- **Engineering**: engineering, technology, technical
- **Business/Management**: business, management, administration, policy
- **Science**: science, scientific, research
- **Computer Science**: computer science, computing, software, programming
- **Other**: Programs that don't fit into specific categories
