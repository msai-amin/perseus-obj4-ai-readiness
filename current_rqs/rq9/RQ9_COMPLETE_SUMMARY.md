## Conclusion

The RQ9 analysis reveals significant insights into technology research infrastructure supporting academic programs in forestry and related fields. The findings demonstrate that:

1. **GIS and AI technologies have the strongest research infrastructure support**, with 42 and 38 infrastructure units respectively
2. **156 programs benefit from technology research infrastructure**, showing significant integration between academic programs and research facilities
3. **Research centers and laboratories show different program support patterns**, with laboratories providing higher program density (2.9 programs per unit) compared to research centers (2.2 programs per unit)
4. **University infrastructure rankings reveal concentration patterns**, with the top 10 universities accounting for 56.9% of total technology research infrastructure

These insights provide valuable guidance for strategic infrastructure development and program-research alignment. Universities with limited technology infrastructure can prioritize development in high-impact areas like GIS and AI, while the success of laboratory-based approaches suggests that smaller, focused facilities may be more cost-effective for direct program support.

The analysis contributes to the broader understanding of research infrastructure in professional forestry education and provides a foundation for future infrastructure development and strategic planning initiatives. The identification of infrastructure gaps and successful models offers guidance for universities seeking to enhance their technology research capabilities and program support systems.

The multi-dimensional approach reveals complex patterns in research infrastructure distribution and program associations, providing comprehensive insights for educational institutions seeking to optimize their technology research capabilities and program support systems.
