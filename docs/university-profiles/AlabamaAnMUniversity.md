# **Alabama A\&M University**

## **Introduction**

This report provides an assessment of the Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Forestry program at Alabama A\&M University (AAMU), focusing on its Society of American Foresters (SAF) accreditation status and the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and related advanced computational techniques within its core faculty's research. AAMU holds the distinction of offering the only SAF-accredited traditional forestry program at a Historically Black College or University (HBCU) 1, positioning it uniquely within the landscape of forestry education and research in the United States.

The B.S. in Forestry program, housed within the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Sciences (NRES), maintains its SAF accreditation through 2029, following a period of probation from 2019 to 2023\.3 This accreditation underscores the program's adherence to national standards despite recent challenges.

Analysis of the core forestry faculty identified through university sources reveals expertise clustered in key areas including Remote Sensing/GIS, Forest Ecology and Wildlife, Biometry and Forest Operations, and Forest Policy and Extension.1 These areas, particularly RS/GIS and biometry/biostatistics, represent fertile ground for the application of AI and advanced computational methods.

However, based on available program descriptions and faculty profiles, explicit evidence of significant, current AI/ML application or development within the core faculty's research (c. 2017-2024) is limited. A comprehensive assessment necessitates a deeper review of recent publications and funded projects for each faculty member, which was beyond the scope of the information provided for this analysis. Nonetheless, the existing faculty expertise and established research themes (e.g., wildlife detection, forest restoration, management effects, RS/GIS analysis), often supported by funding mechanisms like the McIntire-Stennis program 1, indicate substantial latent potential for integrating AI techniques. Key potential faculty contributors in the AI/computational space, based on their foundational expertise, include those specializing in RS/GIS and biostatistics/biometry.

Identified gaps appear to relate more to the explicit adoption and integration of AI methodologies rather than a lack of relevant research questions. Strategic considerations for AAMU include leveraging its unique HBCU identity to focus AI research on mission-relevant areas (e.g., environmental justice, minority landowner support), pursuing targeted capacity building in AI for existing faculty, strengthening partnerships (particularly with the US Forest Service) to access AI resources and expertise, and potentially integrating foundational AI/data science concepts into the curriculum. Addressing potential resource constraints, possibly linked to the previous probationary period or the broader HBCU funding landscape, will also be crucial for realizing the program's potential in AI-driven forestry research.

## **Program Overview and SAF Accreditation**

**A. Program Identification**

Alabama A\&M University (AAMU), located in Normal, Alabama, offers a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Forestry degree program.2 This undergraduate program is administratively situated within the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Sciences (NRES).5 NRES is one of the departments comprising the College of Agricultural, Life and Natural Sciences (CALNS).1 Some university and external sources occasionally reference a Department of Biological & Environmental Sciences 4; however, NRES appears to be the current primary administrative unit housing the forestry program and its associated faculty based on the most recent departmental staff lists and program descriptions.5 The B.S. in Forestry program is designed to equip students with the knowledge and skills necessary for careers focused on the conservation and sustainable management of forests and associated natural resources.17

**B. SAF Accreditation Status and History**

The Society of American Foresters (SAF) provides specialized accreditation for postsecondary forestry education programs in the United States. SAF accreditation signifies that a program's curriculum and overall quality meet rigorous standards established by the forestry profession, thereby enhancing the professional standing and employment opportunities for graduates.

AAMU's B.S. in Forestry program is currently accredited by SAF.1 The program initially achieved SAF accreditation in 2002\.4 The most recent comprehensive SAF site visit occurred in 2018\.4

Following the 2018 review, the SAF Committee on Accreditation placed the AAMU Forestry program on probation, effective January 1, 2019\.3 Accreditation probation indicates that while the program's accredited status continued, specific deficiencies relative to SAF standards were identified, requiring corrective action and subsequent progress reports to SAF in 2022 and 2023\.3 Such probationary periods often necessitate significant institutional focus and resource allocation to address the identified shortcomings.

Despite this challenge, the program successfully addressed the requirements, and its accreditation was subsequently reaffirmed. Official SAF documentation and related sources indicate the current accreditation term extends through December 31, 2029\.3 One university source lists a reaffirmation date of 2023 8, potentially referring to the year the probation was lifted or an internal reporting cycle, but the 2029 expiration date appears consistent with SAF's typical accreditation cycle length following reaffirmation post-probation.

**C. Significance as an HBCU Program**

AAMU's forestry program holds a unique position within American higher education. It is recognized as the only SAF-accredited *traditional* forestry degree program located at a Historically Black College or University (HBCU).1 This distinction is significant given the historical underrepresentation of African Americans and other minority groups within the forestry profession. AAMU explicitly highlights its role in diversifying the field, noting its status as a major producer of African American scientists and stating that nearly 60% of the African American foresters employed by the USDA Forest Service (USFS) are graduates of AAMU.1

This unique institutional identity and mission may influence the program's research focus and educational priorities. HBCUs often emphasize access, equity, and community engagement. AAMU's program description notes research and outreach related to minority landowner issues and evaluating forest ecosystem services, potentially reflecting this mission focus.1 Furthermore, the program underscores its close partnership with the USFS 1, including co-located USFS employees and collaborative research projects.19 This relationship likely provides valuable research opportunities, funding avenues, internships, and direct career pathways for students, reinforcing the program's contribution to workforce development and diversification.

**D. Contextual Factors**

Several contextual factors emerge from the program's overview. The status as the sole accredited HBCU forestry program provides a distinct identity and mission focus, potentially shaping research directions towards community needs, workforce diversification, and partnerships with agencies like the USFS.1 The recent history of accreditation probation (2019-2023) 3, while successfully resolved, suggests a period where significant institutional resources and faculty effort were likely directed towards meeting accreditation standards. This period might have temporarily diverted focus or resources from other strategic initiatives, such as the adoption of emerging research technologies like AI. Finally, the minor ambiguity regarding the precise name of the hosting department (NRES vs. Biological & Environmental Sciences) across various university and external documents 4 could reflect past administrative restructuring or evolving disciplinary boundaries, though NRES appears to be the current designation.5 Clear departmental structures are generally beneficial for fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, which is often required for complex computational research.

## **Core Forestry Program Faculty**

**A. Identification Methodology**

The identification of core faculty associated with the B.S. in Forestry program focused on individuals holding academic ranks of Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, or Professor within the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Sciences (NRES) or closely affiliated units (e.g., Center for Forestry Excellence, Biological & Environmental Sciences where overlap exists). Faculty were included if their listed expertise directly aligned with key forestry domains relevant to the SAF-accredited curriculum, such as Forest Ecology, Wildlife Management, Silviculture, Forest Restoration, Forest Biometry/Measurements, Forest Operations, Remote Sensing/GIS, Forest Economics/Policy, or Forest Ecosystem Science.

Information was compiled from AAMU's official website, including departmental faculty listings 5, program descriptions 1, SAF accreditation documents 4, and relevant external directories or profiles where available.7 Individuals listed primarily in staff roles (e.g., Project Forester, Administrative Secretary, Technician 5) or whose primary expertise appeared outside core forestry areas (e.g., Soil Physics, Plant Biotechnology, Genetics, Agronomy, Environmental Health, Microbiology) were excluded from this list of core academic faculty, although they may serve as collaborators or contribute to broader departmental research.

**B. Core Faculty Roster**

Based on the methodology and sources above, the following individuals were identified as core academic faculty associated with the AAMU B.S. Forestry program and related research areas as of the time of the source data compilation. Academic ranks and specific expertise areas are derived from the available documentation.

**C. Faculty Expertise and Funding Context**

The identified core faculty demonstrate collective expertise spanning several critical areas within forestry and natural resource management. Notable concentrations exist in:

* **Remote Sensing and GIS:** Drs. Tadesse and Kulawardhana specialize in these geospatial technologies.5  
* **Ecology, Wildlife, and Ecosystems:** Drs. Chen, Hossain, de Souza, Stone, Wang, and Dimov cover landscape ecology, general ecology, wildlife, forest ecosystems, and restoration.1  
* **Biometry, Measurements, and Operations:** Dr. Naka focuses on these quantitative and operational aspects.1  
* **Policy, Economics, and Extension:** Drs. Bowman and Christian address the socio-economic and outreach dimensions.1

This distribution of expertise covers the foundational areas of a traditional forestry program. The presence of faculty specializing in quantitative fields like RS/GIS, biometry, and biostatistics is particularly relevant when assessing the potential for AI integration, as these disciplines often serve as entry points for advanced computational methods.

The McIntire-Stennis (M-S) Cooperative Forestry Research Program appears to be a significant source of research funding for the program, active since 2009\.1 This federal program supports forestry research at land-grant institutions. AAMU's M-S projects have focused on themes such as rare/endangered species detection, restoration silviculture, forest dynamics, management effects on bioindicators, forest operations, and minority landowner issues.1 Several core faculty members, including Drs. Chen, Christian, Naka, Stone, Wang, and Bowman, are explicitly linked to M-S projects.1 This sustained funding stream provides a crucial base for research activities and graduate student training within the program.1 The alignment between these funded research themes and areas where AI is increasingly applied globally suggests potential pathways for incorporating advanced computational techniques into ongoing, funded work, assuming the necessary technical expertise and resources are available.

## **Faculty Research Profile and AI Integration Assessment (c. 2017-2024)**

## **Program Synthesis: AI Research Landscape**

**A. Overall Assessment of AI Integration**

Based on the analysis of the program structure, stated faculty expertise, and research program descriptions derived from the available documentation 1, the explicit integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) as core research methodologies within AAMU's B.S. Forestry program appears limited during the assessment period (c. 2017-2024). The available materials do not prominently feature AI/ML techniques in descriptions of ongoing research or faculty specializations.

However, this surface-level assessment must be interpreted with caution, as it does not incorporate a detailed review of recent faculty publications or grant awards. Crucially, the program possesses significant foundational strengths and relevant expertise in areas that are highly amenable to, and increasingly reliant upon, AI and advanced computational methods in the broader field of forestry and environmental science. The presence of faculty specializing in Remote Sensing/GIS and Biometry/Biostatistics, coupled with active research in ecology, wildlife, and forest management, indicates substantial latent potential for AI integration.

**B. Identified Strengths (or Potential Strengths) in AI Application/Development**

The program's structure and faculty expertise suggest several areas where AI could be effectively applied or where capacity might be most readily developed:

1. **Remote Sensing & GIS Analysis:** The dedicated expertise of Drs. Tadesse and Kulawardhana in RS/GIS 5 provides a strong platform. These fields are increasingly leveraging AI/ML for tasks such as automated satellite or aerial image classification (e.g., using deep learning for land cover mapping or identifying forest disturbances), object detection (e.g., identifying individual trees or specific habitat features), and creating predictive maps (e.g., modeling habitat suitability or fire risk using ML algorithms trained on RS-derived environmental variables). This existing expertise represents a significant potential strength for applying established AI tools to geospatial data.  
2. **Biometrics and Statistical Modeling:** Faculty with expertise in biometry (Dr. Naka) and biostatistics (Dr. Wang) 1 possess the quantitative skills necessary for advanced data analysis. This forms a solid foundation for adopting ML techniques for predictive modeling tasks common in forestry, such as developing more accurate or flexible growth and yield models, estimating forest biomass or carbon stocks using sensor data, or analyzing complex, high-dimensional datasets from forest inventories or ecological studies.  
3. **Ecological & Wildlife Applications:** The program's research activities, including those funded by McIntire-Stennis, cover diverse ecological themes such as wildlife detection, forest restoration, understanding forest dynamics, and assessing management effects.1 These align well with areas where AI is making significant inroads globally. Examples include using computer vision for automated analysis of wildlife camera trap imagery or acoustic recordings, employing ML for species distribution modeling under climate change, predicting the success of restoration treatments, or analyzing complex ecological interactions. The existing research questions provide relevant contexts for potential AI application.

**C. Potential Gaps or Areas for Development**

Despite the potential strengths, several areas may represent gaps or require development for enhanced AI integration:

1. **Explicit AI/ML Methodology Focus:** The available information does not indicate a current faculty focus on the *development* of novel AI/ML algorithms specifically tailored for forestry or environmental problems. The potential appears stronger for the *application* of existing AI tools rather than contributing to the core AI/ML methodology literature. Verifying this requires analysis of publication output.  
2. **Cross-Disciplinary AI Integration:** While foundational expertise exists in RS/GIS and biometry, the extent to which advanced computational techniques, including AI/ML, are actively integrated *across* different research domains within the program (e.g., linking AI-driven RS analysis with ecological field studies, or using optimization algorithms informed by ML predictions in forest operations planning) is unclear from the provided documentation. Fostering such cross-disciplinary computational projects may be an area for future development.  
3. **Computational Resources and Specialized Training:** Implementing AI/ML research often demands significant computational infrastructure (e.g., high-performance computing, GPUs) and specialized expertise or training that goes beyond traditional statistics or GIS curricula. Access to adequate resources and ongoing training opportunities could be a potential bottleneck. This might be influenced by the resource reallocation during the recent accreditation probation period 3 or potentially related to the broader resource landscape for HBCUs.

**D. Key Faculty Contributors (Potential)**

Based on their listed expertise in fields most closely aligned with computational methods and AI applications, the faculty members most likely positioned to currently use or lead future AI integration efforts include:

* **Dr. Wubishet Tadesse** (Professor, RS/GIS, Dept. Chair) 5  
* **Dr. Ranjani Kulawardhana** (Associate Professor, RS/GIS) 5  
* **Dr. Yong Wang** (Professor, Wildlife Ecology/Biostatistics) 1  
* **Dr. Kozma Naka** (Associate Professor, Forest Operation/Biometry/Measurement) 1

Confirmation of their actual involvement in AI-related research requires examining their recent scholarly output.

**E. Opportunities and Pathways**

The strong alignment between AAMU's existing forestry research themes (e.g., restoration, wildlife management, forest operations, RS/GIS applications 1) and the types of problems being addressed by AI/ML in forestry globally presents a clear opportunity. The program is already asking relevant questions; the next step involves adopting more advanced computational tools to answer them. Because faculty possess foundational skills in RS/GIS and statistics, the primary barriers might relate to access to specific AI tools, dedicated training, computational resources, or strategic prioritization rather than a fundamental lack of relevant problems or foundational skills. This suggests that targeted investments or collaborations could potentially lead to relatively rapid progress in AI *application*.

Furthermore, the program's established partnership with the USFS 1 represents a significant potential pathway for enhancing AI capacity. Federal agencies like the USFS are increasingly investing in and utilizing AI/ML for large-scale resource monitoring, analysis, and management decision support. Collaborative projects could provide AAMU faculty and students with access to valuable datasets, sophisticated AI tools, potential funding streams, and technical expertise, thereby facilitating the integration of these methods into the university's research portfolio.

## **Conclusion**

**A. Summary of Findings**

Alabama A\&M University's B.S. in Forestry program, the only SAF-accredited traditional forestry program at an HBCU 1, successfully navigated a probationary period and maintains accreditation through 2029\.3 The program's core faculty possess expertise in essential forestry disciplines, with notable potential strengths for AI integration residing in Remote Sensing/GIS (Tadesse, Kulawardhana) and Biometry/Biostatistics (Naka, Wang).1 Research themes, often supported by McIntire-Stennis funding 1, align well with areas where AI is making global impacts (e.g., ecological modeling, wildlife monitoring, resource assessment).

However, based on available program-level information, explicit evidence of current, widespread AI/ML application or development within the faculty's research portfolio (c. 2017-2024) is limited. A conclusive assessment requires detailed investigation of individual faculty publications and projects. The primary gaps appear to be in the explicit adoption of AI/ML as a core methodology and potentially in the cross-disciplinary integration of these techniques, possibly linked to resource availability or strategic priorities.

**B. Strategic Considerations for AAMU Forestry**

To enhance its research capacity and impact in an era increasingly influenced by data science and AI, AAMU's forestry program might consider the following strategic directions:

1. **Leverage Institutional Identity:** Align AI research initiatives with the university's HBCU mission. This could involve using AI tools for environmental justice research (e.g., mapping disproportionate environmental impacts), applying advanced analytics to understand socio-economic factors influencing resource management by minority communities or landowners 1, or developing AI-driven decision support tools tailored for underserved stakeholders. Such alignment could attract unique funding opportunities and resonate strongly with the institutional context.  
2. **Targeted Capacity Building:** Given the foundational strengths in RS/GIS and biometry/biostatistics 5, focus capacity-building efforts strategically. This could involve providing targeted AI/ML training workshops for key faculty (e.g., Tadesse, Kulawardhana, Wang, Naka), supporting sabbaticals or collaborations focused on acquiring AI skills, or making a strategic hire to bring in specific expertise in AI/ML development applied to environmental sciences.  
3. **Strengthen and Diversify Partnerships:** Actively cultivate the existing partnership with the USFS 1 to explore joint AI projects, data sharing, and access to computational resources or expertise. Additionally, seek collaborations with other universities strong in computational forestry/ecology or with technology sector partners interested in environmental applications of AI.  
4. **Address Resource Needs:** Systematically assess the computational infrastructure, software licenses, and technical support required for sustained AI/ML research. Actively pursue grant opportunities specifically designed to build research capacity at HBCUs, in data science, or in environmental computation to address potential resource constraints, which may have been exacerbated during the focus on resolving accreditation probation.3  
5. **Curriculum Evolution:** Evaluate the potential for integrating foundational data science and AI concepts into the B.S. Forestry curriculum. Leveraging existing faculty strengths in statistics and GIS, introductory modules on data mining, predictive modeling concepts, or the use of AI in RS could better prepare graduates for the evolving technological landscape of the forestry profession.

**C. Final Analytical Remark**

Alabama A\&M University's SAF-accredited forestry program occupies a vital niche in American forestry education and research. While this analysis, limited by the lack of detailed publication data, suggests that the integration of explicit AI/ML methodologies into its research is currently nascent, the program possesses considerable untapped potential. This potential stems from its dedicated faculty with foundational expertise in highly relevant quantitative and ecological domains, its established research themes addressing critical environmental issues, and its significant institutional partnerships, particularly with the USFS. By strategically investing in targeted capacity building, leveraging its unique mission, and fostering collaborations focused on computational approaches, AAMU's forestry program is well-positioned to adopt and apply AI tools. Such integration would not only enhance the impact and scope of its research but also further its important mission of educating a diverse new generation of forestry professionals equipped to tackle the complex challenges of the 21st century. A detailed review of recent faculty publications and funded projects is the necessary next step to fully characterize the current state and trajectory of AI research within the program.
