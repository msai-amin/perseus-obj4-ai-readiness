## **1\. Executive Summary**

This report provides an assessment of the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and related computational techniques within the research activities of core faculty associated with the Society of American Foresters (SAF)-accredited forestry programs at Auburn University's College of Forestry, Wildlife and Environment (CFWE). Auburn CFWE offers three distinct SAF-accredited pathways: a Bachelor of Science (BS) in Forestry, a BS in Biosystems Engineering with a Forest Engineering Option (requiring a Forest Resources Minor for accreditation), and a Master of Natural Resources (MNR) Professional Forester option designed for those with non-forestry undergraduate degrees.

The overall level of AI integration within the research of core faculty linked to these programs is assessed as **Moderate, with significant pockets of High activity**, particularly concentrated in geospatial sciences and ecological modeling. Explicit AI methods like machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) are most prominently applied in the analysis of remote sensing data (LiDAR, satellite imagery) for mapping forest attributes, assessing forest health, and modeling environmental processes. Strengths are evident in geospatial analysis, ecological/environmental modeling, and bioinformatics/genomics.

Potential areas with less explicit AI integration include forest operations/harvesting and forest products/biomaterials, where traditional methods or adjacent computational techniques like optimization and chemometrics appear more prevalent based on available data. Key faculty contributors driving AI and computational research are concentrated within the Geospatial and Environmental Informatics group and related modeling domains. The findings suggest a strong foundation in applying computational tools to forestry challenges, with opportunities for further integration across disciplines.

## **2\. Auburn University: SAF-Accredited Forestry Programs**

### **2.1 Introduction to Auburn CFWE**

Auburn University's College of Forestry, Wildlife and Environment (CFWE) serves as a key institution supporting Alabama's significant forest, wildlife, and natural resources sectors.1 The College aims to prepare students for leadership roles in the sustainable management, utilization, and stewardship of these resources through innovative undergraduate and graduate programs.2 It emphasizes real-world learning, leveraging state-of-the-art facilities and extensive field sites to equip graduates for success.1

### **2.2 Significance of SAF Accreditation**

The Society of American Foresters (SAF) serves as the recognized accrediting body for forestry education programs in the United States, acknowledged by the Council on Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA).3 SAF accreditation signifies that a program meets established standards for preparing students for the forestry profession.3 Graduation from an SAF-accredited program is explicitly noted as a requirement for obtaining Registered Forester status in Alabama and several other states, underscoring its practical importance for professional licensure and career entry.3 This connection between accreditation and professional registration highlights the value placed on these programs by the state and the profession.

### **2.3 Identified SAF-Accredited Programs at Auburn**

Auburn University offers multiple SAF-accredited pathways within the CFWE, demonstrating a commitment to professional forestry standards across different educational levels and disciplinary approaches.

1. **Bachelor of Science (BS) in Forestry:** This undergraduate program focuses on providing students with the knowledge necessary to sustainably manage diverse forest resources.4 The curriculum covers forest biology, land management, forest products, forest health, and silviculture 4, emphasizing biological, ecological, environmental, social, economic, and ethical considerations.5 Students can choose from various emphasis areas in their senior year, including forest biology, land management, forest operations, and spatial analysis, among others.5 This program is explicitly identified as SAF-accredited.1  
2. **Bachelor of Science (BS) in Biosystems Engineering \- Forest Engineering Option (with Forest Resources Minor):** This unique program bridges engineering and forestry. Students complete engineering fundamentals alongside specialized coursework in forest products process engineering, wood structure design, conservation engineering, and forest road design.3 Crucially, they also take core forestry courses in ecology, silviculture, mensuration, economics, management, and operations.3 It is the specific combination of the Forest Engineering option within the Biosystems Engineering major (housed in the College of Engineering) *and* the completion of the Forest Resources Minor (likely containing the necessary forestry coursework) that achieves SAF accreditation.3 This inter-college pathway provides graduates with qualifications as both engineers and foresters.3  
3. **Master of Natural Resources (MNR) \- Professional Forester Option:** This non-thesis graduate degree is tailored for individuals holding bachelor's degrees in fields other than forestry who aspire to become Registered Foresters.6 The program structure involves a mandatory 10-week summer Field Practicum followed by coursework totaling a minimum of 65 semester hours. This includes 35 hours of specified undergraduate foundational courses (e.g., Dendrology, Forest Resource Sampling, Forest Ecology, Silviculture, Forest Economics) and 30 hours of graduate coursework, including required courses like Forest Health and Forest Management, plus electives from a SAF-approved list covering areas like GIS, Forest Operations, and Landscape Ecology.8 This program is explicitly SAF-accredited.6

The existence of these three distinct accredited programs—a traditional BS, an interdisciplinary engineering BS, and a post-baccalaureate MNR—indicates a strategic effort by Auburn to provide multiple accredited routes into the forestry profession, catering to students with diverse academic backgrounds and career aspirations while upholding the standards required for professional registration.3

## **3\. Core Faculty in SAF-Accredited Programs**

## **5\. Synthesis of AI Integration in Auburn Forestry Research**

### **5.1 Overall Level of AI Integration**

The assessment of core faculty research associated with Auburn University's SAF-accredited forestry programs reveals a **Moderate overall level of Artificial Intelligence (AI) integration, characterized by distinct areas of High activity**. While not universally adopted across all sub-disciplines, AI and related advanced computational methods represent significant tools and research foci for a substantial portion of the faculty, particularly those involved in geospatial sciences, environmental modeling, and computational biology. The integration spans a spectrum, from faculty explicitly developing or applying machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms to those utilizing sophisticated simulation, statistical modeling, and data analysis techniques that are computationally intensive and often foundational to AI approaches.

### **5.2 Areas of Strength**

Several key areas demonstrate considerable strength in the application or development of AI and related computational techniques:

1. **Geospatial Analysis and Remote Sensing:** This is arguably the most prominent area of AI/ML application. Multiple faculty members, particularly within the Geospatial and Environmental Informatics group, actively use techniques like ML and DL for processing and analyzing data from LiDAR (including ICESat-2) and various satellite platforms (Landsat, Sentinel, ALOS).21 Applications include mapping forest aboveground biomass 60, canopy cover and height 60, vegetation stress 40, land use/cover 16, and integrating diverse datasets through sensor fusion.60 Faculty like Narine, Arseniou, Fan, Yang, and An demonstrate significant activity in this domain.16 The use of object-oriented classification 79 and advanced algorithms for processing point cloud data 17 further underscores this strength. This concentration of expertise suggests a robust capability for leveraging large-scale spatial data for forest monitoring and assessment.  
2. **Ecological and Environmental Modeling:** A strong contingent of faculty employs diverse modeling approaches to investigate complex ecological and environmental systems. This includes ecosystem modeling 16, Earth system modeling 20, hydrological modeling (often coupled with ANNs or DL) 19, spatial statistics and simulation for landscape change and forest health 18, agent-based modeling for human-environment systems 16, and modeling species responses to disturbance and climate change.36 Faculty such as An, Fan, Kalin, Kumar, Yang, Shearman, Alexander, and Sharma contribute to this area.16 The application of ANNs and DL in hydrological prediction 53 and ML (Random Forest) in post-fire mortality modeling 72 represent explicit AI integration within this broader modeling strength.  
3. **Bioinformatics and Computational Genomics:** A focused area of expertise exists in applying computational methods to biological data at the molecular level. Faculty research includes integrating multi-omics data, modeling gene regulatory networks, utilizing bioinformatics tools, and applying quantitative genetics and potentially genomic selection (which often uses ML) for tree improvement and understanding stress responses.32 Chen and Ding are key contributors in this area.32

### **5.3 Potential Gaps or Areas with Less AI Integration**

Based on the analyzed profiles and publication data, certain areas appear to have less *explicit* integration of advanced AI/ML methods compared to the strengths identified above:

1. **Forest Operations and Harvesting:** While faculty (Cristan, Daniel) research operational efficiency, logistics, costs, and technology adoption 24, the direct application of AI/ML for tasks like real-time optimization, autonomous systems (beyond general mentions 1), or predictive maintenance is not prominently featured in their primary expertise descriptions or recent publication lists found in the snippets. Optimization techniques, which are adjacent to AI, are likely employed implicitly or through traditional operations research methods. A recent collaboration involving Cristan shows DL application for *evaluating* operational impacts (erosion) 44, but primary AI focus within the operations group itself seems less evident.  
2. **Forest Products and Biomaterials:** Research in this area focuses on material properties, composites, adhesives, and processing.9 While Via utilizes chemometrics, a field employing ML techniques for spectral data analysis 30, broader applications of AI (e.g., computer vision for quality control, ML for predicting composite performance beyond NIR, process optimization using AI) are not strongly highlighted for Via, Peng, or Peresin in the available data.  
3. **AI Method Development:** The primary focus across most faculty appears to be the *application* of established AI/ML tools (ANNs, DL, Random Forest, agent-based modeling, spatial statistics) to address specific forestry and environmental questions. There is less evidence in the provided snippets to suggest a primary focus on developing novel AI algorithms or fundamentally advancing AI methodology itself within the CFWE context, although some sophisticated modeling work 16 may contribute methodologically.

It is important to note that these perceived gaps are based on the explicit mention of AI/ML in the reviewed materials. Computational methods, including advanced statistics and optimization, are likely used more broadly than explicitly stated.

### **5.4 Key Faculty Contributors**

Several faculty members stand out for their significant engagement with AI, ML, or advanced computational modeling based on the assessment:

* **High AI/ML Integration:** Lana Narine (ML/DL in Remote Sensing/LiDAR), Latif Kalin (ANN/DL in Hydrology), Li An (AI/Agent-Based Modeling), Timothy Shearman (ML in Disturbance Ecology), Zutao Yang (ML/Modeling in Ecosystems/Remote Sensing).  
* **High Computational/Modeling/Adjacent:** Zhaofei Fan (Spatial Stats/Simulation/Modeling), Hao Chen (Bioinformatics/Genomics Modeling), Chen Ding (Quantitative Genetics/Genomics Modeling), Sanjiv Kumar (Earth System Modeling/Big Data/Stats), Brian Via (Chemometrics/Statistical Modeling).

These individuals represent key nodes of computational expertise within the college.

The pattern observed in the individual faculty assessments suggests that AI/ML adoption is strongly correlated with research areas that inherently involve large, complex datasets or systems. Fields like remote sensing (LiDAR, satellite imagery), climate science, hydrology, and genomics generate vast amounts of data that necessitate advanced computational techniques like ML and DL for effective analysis, pattern recognition, and prediction.19 Similarly, modeling complex ecological or human-environment interactions often benefits from simulation techniques or data-driven approaches like agent-based modeling or ANNs.16 Conversely, disciplines that may rely more heavily on traditional field experiments, lab work, or established operational practices (such as aspects of forest operations, pathology, or products research) show less *explicit* evidence of adopting these specific AI tools in the reviewed materials, although computational statistics and optimization are likely employed.24

This distribution highlights an opportunity. The co-location of strong expertise in both traditional forestry domains and cutting-edge computational/AI methods within the same college 9 creates a fertile ground for cross-disciplinary collaboration. Insights and techniques from geospatial AI/ML 17, for instance, could potentially enhance forest operations planning 24 or disease spread modeling.28 The presence of faculty with appointments or strong interests spanning multiple areas (e.g., Fan, Narine, Arseniou listed under both Forestry and Geospatial/Informatics 9) suggests such collaborations may already be occurring or could be readily fostered.

## **6\. Conclusion**

The research landscape associated with Auburn University's SAF-accredited forestry programs demonstrates a moderate level of AI integration, marked by significant strengths in specific domains. The College of Forestry, Wildlife and Environment possesses considerable expertise in applying computational methods, particularly evident in the fields of geospatial analysis/remote sensing and ecological/environmental modeling. Faculty in these areas routinely leverage advanced tools, including machine learning and deep learning, for analyzing large datasets, mapping forest attributes, and predicting environmental responses. A distinct capability also exists in bioinformatics and computational genomics applied to tree improvement.

While explicit AI/ML applications appear less prevalent in the provided data for forest operations and forest products research compared to geospatial and modeling fields, adjacent computational techniques like optimization and chemometrics are utilized. The overall focus seems geared towards applying existing AI/ML tools to forestry and environmental challenges rather than developing novel AI methodologies.

Auburn's CFWE is well-positioned with a strong core of faculty engaged in computationally intensive research. Future opportunities may lie in fostering greater cross-disciplinary collaboration to extend the application of AI/ML techniques into areas with currently lower adoption rates and potentially exploring the development of AI tools tailored specifically to regional forestry needs. The existing strengths provide a solid foundation for continued advancement in computational forestry research.
