## **2\. Academic Structure: Colleges and Departments**

**University Organization:**  
Cal Poly Humboldt's academic framework is organized into three primary colleges: the College of Arts, Humanities & Social Sciences (CAHSS); the College of Natural Resources & Sciences (CNRS); and the College of Professional Studies (CPS).2 This structure, coupled with the university's ethos, encourages interdisciplinary collaboration and study, a theme that resonates through its strategic planning and program development.2  
**College of Natural Resources & Sciences (CNRS):**  
The College of Natural Resources & Sciences (CNRS) stands as the principal academic unit for the programs and disciplines central to this report. Its mission emphasizes providing high-quality, student-centered, hands-on education within inclusive environments, preparing scientifically literate global citizens.6 CNRS has garnered national recognition for its strengths in natural resources, conservation, ecology, and evolution, reflecting its deep engagement with the surrounding environment.6  
Key departments within CNRS that house programs relevant to this assessment include:

* Environmental Science & Management (ESM) 1  
* Forestry, Fire, & Rangeland Management (FFRM) 2  
* Fisheries Biology 2  
* Wildlife 2  
* Geology 2  
* Oceanography 2  
* Mathematics (which includes the Data Science B.S. program) 2  
* Computer Science 2  
* Environmental Resources Engineering (ERE) 2  
* Biological Sciences (incorporating Botany and Zoology) 2  
* Chemistry 2  
* Physics & Astronomy 2

The strategic consolidation of diverse natural resource disciplines (such as forestry, fisheries, wildlife, and rangeland science) alongside foundational sciences (mathematics, physics, chemistry, geology, biology) and applied computational and engineering fields (computer science, environmental resources engineering) all within the single administrative structure of CNRS presents a significant advantage. This organizational model inherently lowers barriers to cross-departmental teaching, research, and resource sharing, fostering an environment conducive to interdisciplinary collaboration. Such a structure is well-aligned with the university's strategic ambition to be a premier center for the interdisciplinary study of the environment and natural resources, enabling integrated approaches to complex environmental challenges.2

**Absence of Traditional Agriculture College/Department:**  
It is noteworthy that Cal Poly Humboldt, despite its polytechnic designation, does not host a traditional College of Agriculture or discrete departments focused on production agriculture, such as animal science or crop science, which are common in other polytechnic institutions. The university's engagement with agricultural landscapes is primarily channeled through its Rangeland Resource Science program and conservation-oriented partnerships, for instance, with the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS).15  
This distinction suggests that Humboldt's interpretation of its polytechnic mission, particularly concerning agriculture, is oriented towards the sustainable management of natural resources on working lands like rangelands and forests, rather than focusing on intensive agricultural production. This approach is congruent with the ecological characteristics of its North Coast region and a broader institutional commitment to conservation and sustainability. The departmental listings confirm this focus, and partnerships like the USDA NRCS program emphasize conservation practices on private lands rather than production enhancement.2

A variety of minors allow students to complement their major studies. Relevant options include a minor in Geospatial Analysis, Ecological Restoration, Environmental Policy, Natural Resources 1, Applied Statistics 27, Computer Science 12, Hydrology, and Wildland Soils.15  
Certificates:  
Certificate programs offer focused training in specific skill sets. Available certificates include Environmental & Natural Resources Planning, Environmental Education & Interpretation, and Natural Resource Policy & Administration.1 A Geospatial Certificate of Study is also offered, with Basic and Advanced options, though its online delivery format is slated for suspension effective Summer 2025, with on-campus options continuing.28  
The comprehensive suite of programs specifically focused on natural resources and environmental science, often leveraging the unique ecological setting of the North Coast, is a defining characteristic of Cal Poly Humboldt. The established strength in geospatial science, evidenced by dedicated concentrations, minors, and certificates, is noteworthy. Furthermore, the structure of the relatively new B.S. in Data Science, which mandates an area of application, actively promotes the integration of data science skills with these established environmental and natural resource disciplines. This design creates explicit interdisciplinary pathways, facilitating the application of computational approaches to environmental challenges.1

## **5\. Curriculum Analysis: Quantitative & Computational Content**

A detailed examination of Cal Poly Humboldt's curricula reveals varying levels of integration of quantitative and computational methods across its natural resource, environmental science, and data science programs.

Geospatial Science (GIS & Remote Sensing):  
Geospatial science is a prominent and well-integrated component of several key programs. It is offered as a dedicated concentration within the Environmental Science & Management (ESM) B.S. 1, a standalone minor 1, and a certificate program.28  
Specific coursework for the ESM Geospatial Science concentration includes GSP 101 (Introduction to Geographic Information Systems), GSP 270 (Introduction to Remote Sensing), GSP 321 (Intermediate GIS and Spatial Analysis), GSP 322 (GIS Applications), GSP 420 (Advanced Remote Sensing), and GSP 424 (GIS Modeling and Analysis).31  
The Forestry B.S. program incorporates GSP 216 (Introduction to GIS), GSP 316 (Intermediate GIS) in most concentrations, and FOR 307 (Remote Sensing and GIS for Natural Resources).31 The Rangeland Resource Science B.S. requires GSP 101 (Geospatial Concepts) and either GSP 216 or GSP 270 in its core, with the Earth Sciences Emphasis requiring an additional GSP course.19 The Geospatial Certificate of Study includes GSP 101, GSP 216, GSP 270, GSP 316, and GSP 370 (Intermediate GIS).30  
This strong curricular emphasis is supported by faculty expertise, including Sara Hanna (FFRM) who teaches GSP courses and researches landscape ecology and climate change using remote sensing and geospatial technology 32, Tawanda Gara and Jim Graham (ESM) who specialize in Geospatial Science 33, and Larry Fox (FFRM Emeritus) who specialized in remote sensing and GIS.34  
The consistent requirement of introductory and often advanced geospatial coursework across multiple natural resource majors, alongside dedicated programs and specialized faculty, indicates that geospatial analysis is a foundational quantitative skill at Humboldt. This represents a significant computational strength directly applicable to environmental monitoring, resource management, and ecological research.  
Statistics & Quantitative Methods:  
Foundational statistical literacy is a common thread across relevant programs, typically fulfilled by STAT 109 (Introductory Biostatistics) or STAT 108 (Elementary Statistics). These courses are required in Forestry 35, Rangeland Resource Science 19, Fisheries Biology 22, Data Science 36, and the ESM Geospatial Science concentration.31  
Beyond introductory statistics, several programs embed discipline-specific quantitative methods courses. For example, Forestry includes FOR 210 (Forest Measurements and Biometry), FOR 311 (Forest Mensuration and Growth), and, in some concentrations, FOR 424 (Forest Growth and Yield Modeling).31 The Fisheries Biology curriculum features FISH 458/558 (Fish Population Dynamics).22 The ESM program includes ESM 230 (Environmental Methods) and, within the Geospatial concentration, ESM 305 (Quantitative Methods).31 The Environmental Resources Engineering program requires ENGR 322 (Risk and Data Analysis for Engineers).39 Faculty like William Bigg (FFRM Emeritus) specialized in Biometry.34  
For students seeking more advanced statistical training, upper-division statistics courses such as STAT 323 (Probability Theory and Mathematical Statistics), STAT 333 (Linear Regression Models/ANOVA), STAT 404 (Multivariate Statistics), STAT 406 (Sampling Design and Analysis), and STAT 410 (Modern Statistical Modeling) are available, often as electives or as requirements for the Data Science B.S. or the Applied Statistics Minor.26  
At the graduate level, the M.S. in Natural Resources mandates an analytical methods course (4 units). Students select from a list that includes options like STAT 333, STAT 504 (Multivariate Statistics), FISH 558 (Fish Population Dynamics), GSP 510 (Research Methods in Geospatial Science), WLDF 578 (Advanced Ecology of Wildlife Populations), and ESM 510 (Research Methods in Human Dimensions of Natural Resources).26  
This curricular structure suggests an emphasis on applied quantitative methods tailored to the specific needs of various natural resource disciplines, rather than a one-size-fits-all approach to advanced statistics for all natural resource majors. The M.S. program ensures that graduate students acquire a higher level of analytical skill relevant to their chosen field.  
Data Science, AI & Machine Learning:  
Cal Poly Humboldt has established a dedicated B.S. in Data Science, which provides a structured pathway for training in core data science, statistics, and machine learning. Key courses include CS 111 (Computer Science Foundations 1), DATA 111 (Introduction to Programming and Computational Thinking for Data Science), MATH 107 (Introduction to Linear Algebra), STAT 109 (Introductory Biostatistics), DATA 271 (Data Wrangling and Visualization), CS 325 (Database Design), an upper-division Statistics elective (from STAT 323, 333, 404, 406, or 410), DATA 311 (Applied Data Analysis), DATA 322 (Machine Learning for Data Science), DATA 422 (Advanced Data Science Methods and Ethics), and DATA 450W (Data Science Capstone).24 A distinctive feature of this program is the requirement for students to complete an "Area of Application," a cohesive set of at least 15 units (9 upper division) in another discipline. Approved areas include Environmental Sciences and Management, Forestry, Fisheries, Wildlife, Biology, Geology, and Oceanography, among others.9  
The Department of Computer Science offers introductory courses such as CS 445 (Artificial Intelligence) with CS 211 as a prerequisite, CS 458 (Introduction to Machine Learning) requiring CS 358, CS 460 (Data Mining) also requiring CS 358, and CS 464 (Introduction to Data Science) requiring CS 202 and MATH 109.31 (The content of CS 358 is not detailed in the provided materials).  
Within the Environmental Resources Engineering curriculum, courses like ENGR 225, ENGR 226, and ENGR 326 cover Computational Methods for Engineering, and ENGR 322 addresses Risk and Data Analysis for Engineers.39 The M.S. program in Environmental Systems (ERE option) includes ENGR 521 (Advanced Numerical Methods for Engineers).42 However, explicit AI/ML courses are not listed within the ERE curriculum snippets.31  
An examination of the core curricula for ESM, Forestry, Fisheries, Wildlife, and Rangeland Science majors does not reveal explicitly listed AI/ML courses.22 This suggests that while foundational AI/ML education is available through the Data Science and Computer Science programs, the direct integration of these advanced computational techniques into the standard coursework of most natural resource programs is currently limited. The "Area of Application" within the Data Science B.S. serves as the most direct current mechanism for students to formally bridge AI/ML skills with environmental and natural resource domains. This structure presents an opportunity for students to pioneer such integration but also indicates that it is not yet a widespread, embedded component of natural resource training at Humboldt.  
Computational Modeling:  
Explicit modeling courses are present in several programs: FOR 424 (Forest Growth and Yield Modeling) 31, FISH 458/558 (Fish Population Dynamics) 22, GSP 424 (GIS Modeling and Analysis) 31, DATA 322 (Machine Learning for Data Science) 36, CS 445 (Artificial Intelligence) 41, CS 458 (Introduction to Machine Learning) 31, CS 461 (Computational Models) 12, and MATH 460 (Mathematical Modeling).10 At the graduate level, NR 538 (Natural Resource Modeling) is available.44  
Implicitly, many scientific and engineering disciplines rely on modeling. Courses in hydrology (e.g., WSHD 310, WSHD 424, WSHD 524), ecology (e.g., BOT 330, BIOL 534), population dynamics (e.g., WLDF 578), energy systems (e.g., ENGR 331), air quality (e.g., ENGR 534), and water quality (e.g., ENGR 351\) often incorporate modeling techniques, even if not explicitly named as such in course titles.26  
Faculty research further demonstrates modeling capabilities. Kamila Larripa (Mathematics) works on mathematical biology and agent-based modeling.45 Daniel Barton (Wildlife) uses population modeling.46 Ho Yi Wan (Wildlife) has published on habitat suitability and connectivity modeling.43 Mark Henderson and Andre Buchheister (Fisheries) employ ecological modeling.48 Melanie Michalak (Geology) utilizes quantitative techniques for modeling geological processes.49 The Schatz Energy Research Center actively develops and applies models for energy systems, such as the C-BREC model for forest residues, offshore wind feasibility analyses, and microgrid controls.50  
The existing modeling expertise at Humboldt appears predominantly focused on discipline-specific ecological, geological, or physical process models. While foundational mathematical and general computational modeling courses are available, and AI/ML-based modeling is taught within Data Science and Computer Science, the application of these newer, data-driven AI/ML modeling paradigms within the core natural resource departments seems less developed compared to more traditional modeling approaches. This suggests an area where enhanced collaboration and curriculum development could yield significant advancements.

## **6\. Faculty Expertise and Research Highlights**

Cal Poly Humboldt's faculty includes a range of experts whose research incorporates computational and quantitative methods relevant to natural resources and environmental science.

Geospatial Science & Remote Sensing:  
Several faculty members have explicit expertise in geospatial technologies. Within the Department of Environmental Science & Management (ESM), Assistant Professor Tawanda Gara and Professor Jim Graham specialize in Geospatial Science.33 In the Department of Forestry, Fire, & Rangeland Management (FFRM), Lecturer Sara Hanna focuses on landscape ecology and climate change, utilizing remote sensing and geospatial technology in her research and teaching courses like GSP 216 (Introduction to Remote Sensing) and GSP 326 (Intermediate Remote Sensing).32 Professor Emeritus Larry Fox (FFRM) also had a specialization in remote sensing and GIS.34 In the Geography department, Professor Amy Rock is a co-Principal Investigator on a $1 million NSF grant aimed at supporting foreign-born women faculty in geospatial sciences, indicating institutional strength and national recognition in this area.53 Professor Rosemary Sherriff (Geography) also utilizes geospatial approaches in her research on disturbance ecology, including an NSF-funded project assessing conifer drought response across geographic gradients using tree-ring data and carbon isotope ratios.52  
Quantitative Ecology & Environmental Modeling:  
A significant number of faculty across departments engage in quantitative ecology and environmental modeling.

* **Wildlife:** Professor Daniel Barton's research encompasses population ecology, life history evolution, and conservation, frequently employing population modeling techniques.46 Associate Professor Ho Yi Wan has published work on habitat suitability and connectivity modeling.43 Adjunct Professor Alan Franklin's interests include quantitative ecology, wildlife population dynamics, and disease ecology.56  
* **Fisheries Biology:** Assistant Professor Andre Buchheister's research integrates ecological modeling, advanced statistics, and studies of fish population dynamics and ecosystem-based management (bio link needed for confirmation).48 Assistant Unit Leader Mark Henderson uses field data to inform ecological models, including statistical analyses, mark-recapture, growth models, bioenergetics, and individual-based models for studying salmon-environment interactions.48 Professor Emeritus David Hankin worked on survey designs for fish abundance estimation.22 Adjunct Professor Eric Bjorkstedt's research includes fisheries oceanography and population dynamics.48  
* **Forestry, Fire, & Rangeland Management:** Professor Emeritus William Bigg specialized in biometry.34 Assistant Professor Justin Luong focuses on rangeland ecology and restoration, where quantitative methods are often applied (bio link needed for confirmation).34 Adjunct Professor Harold Zald's work in forest ecology may involve modeling and geospatial tools (bio link needed for confirmation).34  
* **Environmental Science & Management:** Professor Alison O'Dowd's research in ecological restoration and aquatic ecology involves bioassessment, quantitative methods, and data analysis.1 Associate Professor Kerry Byrne studies applied ecology and drought impacts on plant communities, likely using quantitative approaches.1  
* **Geology:** Associate Professor and Department Co-Chair Melanie Michalak applies quantitative techniques such as low-temperature thermochronology, detrital geochronology, and cosmogenic radionuclides to study mountain building processes.49  
* **Mathematics:** Associate Professor Kamila Larripa's research in mathematical biology includes agent-based modeling.45

Data Science, AI/ML Applications:  
Expertise in AI and Machine Learning is primarily concentrated within the Data Science B.S. program and the Computer Science department faculty who teach relevant courses (e.g., CS 445 \- Artificial Intelligence, CS 458 \- Introduction to Machine Learning).9 Success stories from the HPC center indicate that faculty like Assistant Professor Alana Chin (Biological Sciences, Plant Physiology) and students under faculty guidance (e.g., Peter Overholser, Schatz Energy Research Center) are utilizing ML/DL techniques for image analysis.63 However, based on the provided materials, there is limited explicit identification of faculty within the natural resource departments whose primary research focus is the application or development of novel AI/ML methodologies for environmental science.  
Energy & Climate Modeling:  
The Schatz Energy Research Center is a key hub for energy and climate modeling. Faculty and staff at the Center possess expertise in renewable energy microgrids, off-grid energy access, offshore wind, bioenergy, transportation, and energy planning.64 Their methodological approaches include system design and integration, monitoring, statistical analysis, feasibility studies, resource assessments, energy planning studies, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), geospatial modeling, and technoeconomic analysis.50 Professor Kevin Fingerman (ESM) is deeply involved in this area, with research utilizing LCA, geospatial modeling, and technoeconomic analysis for energy and climate policy.1 Faculty in Environmental Resources Engineering also likely contribute to energy and water modeling efforts.66  
Collectively, Cal Poly Humboldt possesses considerable faculty depth in traditional quantitative ecology, resource-specific modeling (fisheries, wildlife, forestry), and particularly in geospatial science. Expertise in mathematical and computational modeling is also present within the Mathematics and Computer Science departments. The Schatz Center serves as a significant locus for energy systems modeling and analysis. While foundational AI/ML courses are offered, and some faculty are beginning to apply these techniques, dedicated research programs focusing on novel AI/ML applications within environmental domains appear to be an emerging area rather than a widely established research thrust across the natural resource departments, based on the available documentation. Further investigation of individual faculty publications and current projects would be necessary for a more granular assessment of AI/ML integration.

## **7\. Research Infrastructure & Support**

Cal Poly Humboldt provides a range of research infrastructure and support services critical for advancing studies in natural resources, environmental science, and computational fields.

High-Performance Computing (HPC):  
The university's Information Technology Services (ITS) supports the Humboldt High Performance Computing Center (HHPCC).63 Researchers and students have access to significant computational resources, including the National Research Platform (NRP) and the TIDE cluster. Cal Poly Humboldt is a member of the NRP, a consortium offering free HPC resources funded by the National Science Foundation.78  
These HPC resources are actively used for diverse research projects, such as redwood tomography image processing, GPU-intensive image segmentation modeling, deep learning image classification (also utilizing GPUs), and various simulations.63 Access mechanisms include JupyterHub, which provides a graphical user interface suitable for Python and R, with implied support for libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch (though run times are limited to 6 hours and 16 CPUs/GPUs), and Kubernetes, a command-line environment offering fewer restrictions, indefinite run times, and support for custom environments.78 The available hardware includes multiple CPUs, significant RAM, and GPU capabilities, with Nvidia K80 nodes mentioned in the context of a supercomputer build.63  
While specific technical details such as CPU types, precise core counts, total RAM figures for NRP/TIDE, specific GPU models and quantities, and available storage capacity are not extensively detailed in the provided materials 63, the success stories affirm the functional capacity of these systems. Similarly, a comprehensive public list of specific AI/ML software modules or libraries beyond general Python/R environments is not readily available.63  
Faculty and students can request access to these HPC resources by contacting ITS Research Support (itsresearchsupport@humboldt.edu or phone 4100\) for consultations and to discuss project needs.63 ITS also offers support for pre-award consultations, hardware and code review, building custom containers, parallel computing, software recommendations, and storage solutions.63  
The existing HPC infrastructure, including crucial GPU availability, provides a solid foundation for computationally demanding research. However, the limited public availability of detailed technical specifications and comprehensive user documentation could present a challenge for researchers requiring precise information for planning and optimizing complex computational tasks. This contrasts with the often detailed public-facing documentation provided by many university HPC centers and may represent an area for improvement to enhance broader adoption and more efficient utilization of these valuable resources.

Key Research Facilities & Labs:  
Cal Poly Humboldt's unique location is complemented by significant field-based research infrastructure:

* The **Telonicher Marine Lab**, located minutes from campus, facilitates marine education and research with features like a recirculating seawater system, a remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV), a wet laboratory for rearing marine organisms, and a culture room.79  
* The **R/V Coral Sea**, a 90-foot ocean-going research vessel, allows students and faculty to collect samples and observe marine life in their natural environment, equipped with labs and deck space for oceanographic equipment.79  
* The **L.W. Schatz Demonstration Tree Farm**, a 385-acre forest property, serves as a vital field experiment station for forestry research, an outdoor classroom, and a demonstration area for sustainable timberland management practices.81  
* The **Schatz Energy Research Center** is a globally recognized leader in clean and renewable energy technology research, focusing on areas such as microgrids, off-grid energy access, offshore wind, and bioenergy.64 In addition to these, the university hosts the CNRS Core Research Facility (a community lab workspace), the Dennis K. Walker Greenhouse, the Vertebrate Museum, the Vascular Plant Herbarium, the Wildlife Museum, a well-equipped Wildland Fire Lab, a campus Fish Hatchery, a Gravity Lab, and the Fickle Hill Observatory.79 This diverse array of facilities provides substantial support for hands-on research and learning across a wide range of natural resource and scientific disciplines, strongly aligning with the university's polytechnic mission and its emphasis on place-based education.

Office of Research & Sponsored Programs (OSPR):  
The Office of Research & Sponsored Programs (operating through the Sponsored Programs Foundation, SPF) provides comprehensive administrative support for research activities at Cal Poly Humboldt.83 OSPR assists faculty and staff throughout the entire grant lifecycle, from identifying funding opportunities (utilizing resources like Pivot, InfoReady, and the internal Engagement Hub) and supporting proposal development (including the Institutional Routing and Authorization Form, IRAF, process) to post-award management and ensuring compliance with funding agency regulations.83 OSPR also manages institutional financials and metrics related to research and offers initiatives like the Strategic Matching Fund to encourage external grant applications.84 This centralized support system is crucial for enabling faculty to pursue and manage complex research projects, particularly those requiring significant computational resources, extensive fieldwork, or external funding.

## **8\. Strategic Direction & Initiatives**

Cal Poly Humboldt's strategic direction is shaped by its overarching university plan, college-level priorities, and its success in securing external funding for specific initiatives.

University Strategic Plan (2021-2026):  
The university's strategic plan articulates a vision to provide high-quality, affordable education, emphasizing a commitment to a just and sustainable world, built upon the contributions of a diverse community.5 Key themes guiding this plan include the Academic Roadmap, Community Collaboration & Shared Success, Employee Engagement & Success, Future Proofing Humboldt, Resources Stewardship & Sustainability, and Student Experience & Success.5  
A central element of the plan is the ambition to be a "premier center for the interdisciplinary study of the environment, climate crisis and resilience to climate change, and the conservation of ecological systems and natural resources," with a strong focus on sustainability.5 This includes partnering with Indigenous communities and integrating Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) into its academic and research endeavors.5 The Academic Roadmap specifically supports the polytechnic designation by promoting distinctive, innovative academic programs and hands-on, interdisciplinary, equity-informed teaching and learning.5  
While the strategic plan strongly aligns with the strengths of the College of Natural Resources & Sciences (CNRS) and reinforces the value of applied learning, the provided documents do not contain explicit top-level strategic goals for developing advanced computational research capabilities in areas such as AI, data science, or HPC infrastructure.5 The focus appears to be broader, emphasizing distinctive academic programs, equity, sustainability, and the overall polytechnic educational experience. This suggests that the development of specific advanced computational research areas may be driven more at the college or departmental level, or emerge organically from faculty initiatives, rather than being a distinct, university-wide strategic imperative articulated in the current plan.  
CNRS Strategic Plan (Developed 2017-2018):  
The College of Natural Resources & Sciences' strategic plan, formulated prior to the most recent university-wide plan and polytechnic transition, outlines a mission centered on high-quality, student-centered, hands-on learning in inclusive environments.6 The plan acknowledges CNRS's national leadership in natural resources, conservation, ecology, and evolution, its high rate of undergraduates pursuing Ph.D.s, and significant extramural funding.6  
However, it also identified challenges such as eroding teaching power and staff support, low four-year graduation rates, equity gaps, and needs for improved research space and graduate program support.6 Consequently, the goals of this plan focused on raising educational quality, promoting inclusivity and equity, exemplifying and teaching environmental sustainability, becoming a recognized research center through existing strengths, ensuring employee satisfaction, and securing funding.6  
The executive summary of the CNRS plan does not explicitly mention strategic goals related to enhancing AI, data science, or computational modeling capabilities.6 This suggests that at the time of its development, the primary strategic drivers were foundational improvements in educational delivery, equity, and resource stability, rather than a targeted expansion of specific advanced computational research areas.  
College of Professional Studies (CPS) and Academic Affairs Plans:  
Strategic planning within the College of Professional Studies emphasizes shared governance, resource management, curriculum oversight, and student success.88 The broader Academic Affairs plan, which encompasses CPS, includes objectives such as increasing online and hybrid course offerings, supporting the polytechnic conversion, enhancing hands-on learning experiences, fostering professional development, implementing a data-informed budget model, and increasing global engagement.89 These plans do not contain specific mentions of AI, data science, or computational research initiatives directly related to natural resource programs.  
Externally Funded Projects & Partnerships:  
Cal Poly Humboldt faculty, particularly within CNRS, have demonstrated success in securing external funding. Notable examples include:

* **National Science Foundation (NSF):** A $1 million grant co-led by Geography Professor Amy Rock to support foreign-born women faculty in geospatial sciences 53; approximately $400,000 for research on conifer drought response modeling led by Professors Rosemary Sherriff (Geography) and Lucy Kerhoulas (FFRM) 53; a $19 million NSF Coastlines and People Hub grant with Professors Jennifer Marlow (ESM) and Laurie Richmond (ESM) as co-PIs for the Humboldt component ($452,861) 90; and a $199,574 NSF award (2332937) to the Cal Poly Humboldt Sponsored Programs Foundation, though specific project details involving computation or natural resources are not accessible from the snippet.91 A student project on elk parturition event identification using spatial modeling was also published.43  
* **U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA):** A $600,000 NRCS partnership for on-the-job training to encourage Hispanic students towards NRCS careers 15; a NIFA planning grant for the California Rangeland Education (CRED) program involving Professor Susan Edinger Marshall (FFRM) 93; and a $785,000 USDA grant to Professor Kun Zhang (likely ERE) for roadway sustainability research.94 An opportunity for the NIFA Equipment Grant Program was also noted.95  
* **Other Agencies:** Grants from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) for redwood tree ring and earthquake dating research (Carroll, Sillett, Antoine) 93; the Save The Redwoods League for Sonoma tree vole research (N. Kerhoulas, L. Kerhoulas) 43; the California Ocean Protection Council (Wiyot Tribe/Richmond) 90; the California Environmental Protection Agency (Humboldt Baykeeper) 90; and the California Coastal Commission (Humboldt Baykeeper).90

The pattern of external funding indicates a strong alignment with Humboldt's established expertise in natural resources, environmental science, geospatial analysis, and its commitment to the local region and Indigenous communities. While computational tools like modeling and geospatial analysis are employed within these funded projects, large-scale grants with a primary focus on developing or applying novel AI/Data Science methods to environmental challenges are not prominently featured in the available documentation. This suggests that funding tends to follow and build upon existing strengths rather than seeding entirely new research directions in advanced computational environmental science at this time.

## **9\. Responsible Research & AI Ethics**

Cal Poly Humboldt addresses responsible research practices and the ethical considerations of artificial intelligence through a combination of institutional policies, CSU system-wide guidance, and specific program components.

Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR):  
The university utilizes the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI Program) for research ethics education.96 Completion of CITI training is mandatory for Institutional Review Board (IRB) proposal approval.96 Specifically, the "Social & Behavioral Research \- Basic/Refresher, Basic Course" is required for IRB submissions by undergraduate students, graduate students, faculty, and staff.96 While other CITI modules, such as general RCR, RCR for engineers, or RCR for administrators (as seen at Cal Poly Pomona 97), may be available, the primary mandated course for Humboldt researchers interacting with human subjects is the Social & Behavioral Research module. The National Science Foundation (NSF) and National Institutes of Health (NIH) generally require institutions to have plans for RCR training for students and postdoctoral researchers supported by their grants.97 However, specific RCR training requirements or recommended modules tailored for researchers in STEM or natural resource fields at Cal Poly Humboldt, beyond the foundational IRB CITI course, are not detailed in the provided materials.98  
AI Ethics:  
The approach to AI ethics at Cal Poly Humboldt is guided by broader CSU system policies and integrated into academic integrity frameworks and specific curricula. The CSU system provides guidance on the ethical and responsible use of AI in education, encouraging a thoughtful balance of benefits and risks while addressing issues of fairness, privacy, and potential biases.99 System-wide guidelines exist for the safe and responsible use of generative AI tools, emphasizing data security, privacy, compliance with regulations, and respect for intellectual property.99 The CSU also references the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF 1.0).99  
At the Cal Poly Humboldt campus level, the Dean of Students office maintains a webpage addressing Student Rights concerning AI and Academic Dishonesty.100 The Center for Teaching & Learning (CTL) offers resources for educators and students on generative AI tools, including guidance on proper citation of AI-generated content, considerations for academic integrity, and awareness of potential biases in AI detection software.100 The B.S. in Data Science program incorporates an ethics component that specifically addresses privacy issues and the biases that can be inherent in data and algorithms.9 Additionally, campus discussions, such as an AI & Sustainability Panel, indicate ongoing engagement with the broader implications of AI technologies.102  
Despite these resources and discussions, the provided materials do not point to a distinct, Humboldt-specific institutional policy on AI ethics in research that extends beyond the general CSU guidance and existing academic integrity rules.96 This suggests that while awareness and foundational ethical considerations are being promoted, a formalized, comprehensive AI ethics framework specifically for research conduct at Humboldt may still be an evolving area.

## **10\. Synthesis and Conclusion**

Summary of Findings:  
Cal Poly Humboldt demonstrates significant strengths in natural resource and environmental science education and research, deeply rooted in its unique North Coast location and hands-on learning philosophy. The institution has established robust capabilities in geospatial science (GIS and Remote Sensing), which are well-integrated across numerous academic programs within the College of Natural Resources & Sciences (CNRS). A functional High-Performance Computing (HPC) infrastructure, including access to the National Research Platform (NRP) and TIDE clusters with GPU support, provides essential tools for computationally intensive research. The recent introduction of a B.S. in Data Science, with its requirement for an area of application, signals a commitment to fostering interdisciplinary skills. Faculty expertise is notable in traditional quantitative ecology, discipline-specific resource modeling (e.g., forestry, fisheries, wildlife), and energy systems analysis, particularly within the Schatz Energy Research Center. The university's strategic plans strongly emphasize sustainability, environmental justice, and its polytechnic identity, aligning well with the academic strengths of CNRS.  
Identified Gaps and Opportunities for Development:  
While foundational computational skills are present, the explicit integration of advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and sophisticated data science methodologies within the core curricula of most natural resource programs appears to be an area with potential for growth. While the Data Science B.S. program provides a crucial bridge, direct incorporation of these techniques into environmental science coursework could further enhance student preparedness.  
The technical specifications and user documentation for the available HPC resources could be made more readily accessible and transparent to the broader campus community to facilitate wider adoption and more efficient utilization. Although faculty are engaged in computational research, those with a primary research focus on applying novel AI/ML techniques to environmental science challenges are not prominently visible in the reviewed materials, suggesting this may be an emerging, rather than fully established, research thrust within CNRS. Furthermore, while the university's strategic plan champions environmental study and its polytechnic mission, it currently lacks explicit, high-level goals for systematically building advanced computational research capacity across the institution, particularly in the context of its environmental strengths.  
Potential and Future Directions:  
Significant potential exists for Cal Poly Humboldt to further leverage its existing assets. The Data Science B.S. program's "Area of Application" requirement is a key mechanism for bridging computational expertise with the deep domain knowledge within the natural resource programs. Encouraging and supporting collaborative research projects that unite data scientists with environmental scientists could lead to innovative solutions for complex ecological and resource management problems. Broader and more strategic utilization of the HPC resources across CNRS, facilitated by improved documentation and training, could significantly enhance research capabilities.  
Developing more explicit AI/ML training modules or concentrations within environmental programs, or fostering dual-major pathways, could directly align with the university's polytechnic goals and meet the evolving demands of the environmental science job market. There is also an opportunity to build upon the existing interdisciplinary culture to foster research that combines geospatial analysis, traditional environmental modeling, and newer AI/ML techniques.  
Overall Assessment:  
Cal Poly Humboldt stands as a strong institution for education and research in natural resources and environmental science, distinguished by its commitment to field-based learning and established expertise in geospatial applications. Its growing computational infrastructure and the nascent Data Science program provide a solid foundation for future expansion into data-intensive environmental research. To fully realize its potential as a leading polytechnic university in these interconnected fields, Humboldt may benefit from strategically enhancing the integration of advanced computational methodologies, particularly AI and ML, into its environmental science curricula and research programs. This could be achieved through targeted faculty development, curriculum innovation, and more explicit strategic initiatives aimed at building world-class computational research capacity that complements its profound strengths in understanding and managing the natural world.
