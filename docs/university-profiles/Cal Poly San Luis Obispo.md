# **Cal Poly San Luis Obispo**

## **I. Executive Summary**

This report provides an in-depth analysis of California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo (Cal Poly SLO) and its integration of advanced computational methodologies—including Geographic Information Systems (GIS), remote sensing, quantitative methods, statistics, modeling, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), High-Performance Computing (HPC), and data science—within its academic programs, research initiatives, and strategic vision related to natural resources, forestry, environmental science, and agriculture.

Cal Poly SLO demonstrates notable strengths in this interdisciplinary domain, heavily influenced by its "Learn by Doing" philosophy. The College of Agriculture, Food and Environmental Sciences (CAFES) houses robust programs in natural resources and environmental sciences, with foundational training in GIS and applied statistics. The Natural Resources Management and Environmental Sciences (NRES) department, in particular, shows significant activity in geospatial research, leveraging facilities like the Swanton Pacific Ranch and the NRES Geospatial Systems Lab. Interdisciplinary minors, such as the Cross Disciplinary Studies Minor in Data Science and the Geographic Information Systems Minor, offer pathways for students to gain specialized computational skills.

The College of Engineering (CENG) and the Bailey College of Science and Mathematics (COSAM) provide the core expertise in advanced computation through their Computer Science and Statistics departments, respectively. These departments offer a range of undergraduate and graduate courses in AI, ML, data science, and related fields. Research centers like the Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) Fire Institute and the university-wide Digital Transformation Hub (DxHub), powered by Amazon Web Services (AWS), serve as critical nexuses for applied research, external funding, and the application of AI and data analytics to real-world challenges, including those in environmental and agricultural sectors.

However, the analysis also identifies areas for potential strategic development. While foundational computational skills are present in natural science programs, accessing advanced computational coursework, particularly in AI/ML from the Computer Science department, presents a considerable prerequisite challenge for students outside of computational majors. The current status and accessibility of centralized HPC and GPU resources for broad research use require greater clarity. Furthermore, while strategic plans at the university and college levels support leveraging technology and addressing sustainability, a more explicit articulation of strategies for integrating advanced AI and data science specifically within natural resource and environmental research programs could further galvanize efforts.

This report examines these facets in detail, offering a comprehensive view of Cal Poly SLO's current capabilities and strategic positioning at the intersection of natural and computational sciences, and concludes with strategic recommendations to enhance its leadership in this evolving, critical field.

## **II. Academic Landscape: Integrating Natural Sciences with Computational Methods**

The effective integration of computational sciences within natural resources, environmental science, and agriculture at Cal Poly SLO is predicated on the structure and offerings of its academic units, the design of its curricula, and the quality assurance mechanisms in place.

**A. Key Academic Units: Colleges and Departments**

The academic programs and expertise relevant to this analysis are primarily distributed across three key colleges at Cal Poly SLO: the College of Agriculture, Food and Environmental Sciences (CAFES), the College of Engineering (CENG), and the Bailey College of Science and Mathematics (COSAM).1

CAFES serves as the home for programs directly focused on natural resources, environmental science, and agriculture.1 Within CAFES, the **Natural Resources Management and Environmental Sciences (NRES) department** is central, offering several relevant bachelor's degrees and a master's program.4 This department emphasizes hands-on learning and management of resources related to soil, water, forests, range, and wildlife.5

CENG hosts the **Computer Science and Software Engineering (CSSE) department**, which provides the core curriculum and advanced studies in computer science, software engineering, AI, and data science.8 Other engineering departments within CENG, such as the **Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEENVE) department**, also contribute through areas like environmental modeling and water resources engineering.11

COSAM includes the **Statistics Department**, which offers undergraduate and potentially graduate programs in statistics and plays a key role in the cross-disciplinary Data Science minor.3 The Statistics Department is fundamental for providing the theoretical and applied statistical knowledge crucial for quantitative analysis and data science.

The distribution of domain-specific natural science expertise (largely in CAFES) and advanced computational expertise (largely in CENG and COSAM) underscores the importance of robust inter-college and inter-departmental collaboration. For students and researchers to effectively bridge these fields, pathways for accessing coursework, faculty mentorship, and research opportunities across these administrative boundaries are essential. The existence of cross-disciplinary minors, such as the Data Science minor co-offered by CSSE and Statistics 8, is a positive structural indicator of such collaboration. However, the depth of computational integration *within* the core natural science programs, beyond reliance on minors, is a critical factor in assessing the pervasive computational literacy of graduates in these fields.

**B. Undergraduate Programs in Natural Resources, Environmental & Agricultural Sciences**

The NRES department within CAFES offers several undergraduate programs central to this analysis:

1. **Bachelor of Science (BS) in Forest and Fire Sciences:** Previously named Forestry and Natural Resources, this program prepares students for careers in the protection and management of forests and natural resources. The curriculum emphasizes forest ecosystem management, dendrology, forest practices, environmental protection, fire ecology, and watershed management.4  
2. **Bachelor of Science (BS) in Environmental Management and Protection:** This program focuses on the science and management background needed to protect environmental values and ensure the sustainable consumption of natural resources. Core coursework covers ecosystem structures, environmental policy and law, and sustainable agriculture.5  
3. **Bachelor of Science (BS) in Environmental Earth and Soil Sciences:** This degree provides a foundation in geology, soil science, and geography, with opportunities for specialization in areas such as climate change studies, geospatial technology, and hydrology.5

**Curriculum Analysis for Computational and Quantitative Content:**

* **Geographic Information Systems (GIS):** A foundational course, **NR 218/LA 218 Introduction to Geographic Information Systems**, is common across these NRES programs.15 It utilizes the ArcGIS platform and covers the creation, management, analysis, and display of geographically referenced data for various applications.18 Further specialization is available through the **Geographic Information Systems Minor** (or the **Geographic Information Systems for Agriculture Minor**), which teaches GIS, Global Positioning Systems (GPS), and orthophotography.4 The GIS for Agriculture Minor includes courses like BRAE 345 (Aerial Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing) or GEOG 328, NR/LA 218 or GEOG 218, and NR 418 (Applied GIS) or GEOG 441, with specific emphasis areas such as Environmental Information or Precision Agriculture.21  
* **Remote Sensing:** While not always a standalone core requirement in all NRES majors, exposure to remote sensing concepts is present. **BRAE 345 Aerial Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing** is an option for Environmental Management and Protection majors 15 and is a component of the GIS for Agriculture Minor.21 The mention of orthophotography in the general GIS minor description also suggests an introduction to remote sensing products.4  
* **Quantitative Methods and Statistics:** NRES programs integrate quantitative and statistical training. The Forest and Fire Sciences program includes a course on **Measurements and Sampling in Forested Environments**, covering sampling, statistical, and inventory techniques.4 The Environmental Management and Protection curriculum requires either **STAT 217 Introduction to Statistical Concepts and Methods** or **STAT 218 Applied Statistics for the Life Sciences**.15 The Environmental Earth and Soil Sciences curriculum emphasizes methods of data collection and interpretation, typically incorporating a course like STAT 218\.16 Furthermore, a course like **NR 304 Agroecology** lists STAT 217 or STAT 218 as prerequisites and focuses on experimental design and data interpretation.18  
* **Modeling:** Elements of modeling are present, particularly within specific concentrations or advanced courses. The Forest and Fire Sciences program's "Silviculture and Vegetation Management" course covers natural stand dynamics 4, and its Watershed Management and Hydrology concentration likely involves hydrological modeling.4 **NR 308 Forest and Fire Modeling** specifically addresses models for fire behavior and suppression.18 The Environmental Management and Protection program also offers a Watershed Management and Hydrology concentration 15, and **NR 445 Systems Thinking in Environmental Management** may incorporate modeling approaches.2 The Environmental Earth and Soil Sciences program, particularly its Hydrology concentration, emphasizes data interpretation which often underpins modeling 17, and a course like **ERSC 443 Applied Environmental Contaminant Transport** is likely to involve modeling.2  
* **Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) and Data Science:** Explicit, dedicated courses in AI/ML or comprehensive data science methodologies are generally not listed as core requirements *within* these NRES undergraduate programs based on the available information. Students seeking such expertise would typically need to pursue these through minors (like the Data Science minor) or electives offered by other departments, primarily CSSE or Statistics.

Accreditation Status:  
The quality and standing of Cal Poly SLO's programs are affirmed through both institutional and programmatic accreditation:

* **Institutional Accreditation:** Cal Poly SLO is accredited by the WASC Senior College and University Commission (WSCUC), a federally-recognized regional accrediting body. This accreditation is vital for institutional eligibility for federal funding, including student financial aid and research grants, and validates the overall quality and integrity of the university.22  
* **Programmatic Accreditation:**  
  * The **BS in Forest and Fire Sciences** program (formerly Forestry and Natural Resources) holds accreditation from the **Society of American Foresters (SAF)**.4 SAF accreditation is a non-governmental, peer-review process ensuring that forestry programs meet rigorous standards of educational excellence established by the profession, preparing graduates for professional practice.24  
  * The **BS in Environmental Management and Protection** major is endorsed by the **California Association of Environmental Professionals (AEP)** 7, signifying alignment with professional standards and practices in California.

The integration of foundational GIS and statistics into NRES undergraduate programs provides students with essential tools for quantitative environmental analysis. However, for students wishing to attain deeper expertise in advanced remote sensing, complex systems modeling, and particularly AI/ML or broader data science techniques, the pathway appears to lead outside the core NRES curricula. This suggests that while a solid foundation is laid, mastery of more advanced computational methods often requires proactive engagement with minors or elective coursework from CENG or COSAM. This structure presents an opportunity for NRES programs to consider further embedding advanced computational modules or creating dedicated computational tracks within their majors to better equip all their graduates for an increasingly data-driven environmental sector.

**Table 1: Overview of Relevant Undergraduate Programs in Natural Resources, Environmental & Agricultural Sciences**

| Program Name (BS) | Department | College | Key Specializations/Concentrations Relevant to Query | Core Computational/Quantitative Courses Mentioned (Illustrative) | Accreditation/Endorsement |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Forest and Fire Sciences | Natural Resources Management & Env. Sciences (NRES) | College of Agriculture, Food & Env. Sciences (CAFES) | Watershed Management and Hydrology, Wildlife Biology, Wildland Fire and Fuels Management | NR 218 (GIS), Measurements & Sampling in Forested Environments | Society of American Foresters (SAF) |
| Environmental Management and Protection | Natural Resources Management & Env. Sciences (NRES) | College of Agriculture, Food & Env. Sciences (CAFES) | Watershed Management and Hydrology, Wildlife Biology; options for geospatial technology coursework | NR 218 (GIS), STAT 217 or STAT 218 | California Association of Environmental Professionals (AEP) Endorsement |
| Environmental Earth and Soil Sciences | Natural Resources Management & Env. Sciences (NRES) | College of Agriculture, Food & Env. Sciences (CAFES) | Geology, Hydrology, Geospatial Technology; curriculum emphasizes data collection & interpretation | NR 218 (GIS), STAT 218 (typically) |  |

**C. Graduate Programs**

Cal Poly SLO offers several graduate programs relevant to the intersection of natural sciences and computational methods:

* **Master of Science (MS) in Environmental Sciences & Management (MSESM):** Housed in the NRES department (CAFES), this program offers advanced study across a range of environmental disciplines.7 The core curriculum includes ESCI 501 (Research Planning), ESCI 502 (Research Methods and Data Analysis), ESCI 550 (Advanced Environmental Sciences), and ESCI 590 (Advanced Environmental Management). A significant portion of the program (16 out of 45 units) consists of directed electives at the 400 or 500 level, allowing students to tailor their studies to their interests and chosen emphasis, in consultation with their research supervisor or program coordinator.7 The ESCI 502 course is central to providing quantitative skills. The program's strength in advanced computational methods heavily depends on the availability of relevant electives from departments like CSSE or Statistics and the presence of NRES faculty capable of supervising computationally intensive theses or projects. While flexible, the program does not explicitly name computational tracks like "Geospatial Analysis for Environmental Management" or "Environmental Data Science" in its overview.7  
* **Master of Science (MS) in Computer Science:** Offered by the CSSE department (CENG), this program prepares students for careers and advanced research in areas including software engineering, AI, database systems, and distributed computing.8 This program provides the deep computational expertise that can be applied to environmental challenges. A blended BS \+ MS in Computer Science program is also available.8  
* **Master of Science (MS) in Business Analytics:** Offered by the Orfalea College of Business (OCOB), this program focuses on applying data science to business decision-making.3 It covers statistics, machine learning, econometrics, and data management. While business-oriented, the analytical and technical skills are transferable to environmental data challenges.  
* **Master of Science (MS) in Statistics:** While detailed curriculum was not consistently available across all searched documents, the Statistics Department does offer an MS program. Admission requirements include undergraduate coursework in statistics (at least two courses, including the equivalent of Cal Poly's STAT 302), multivariable calculus (MATH 241), and linear algebra (MATH 206), and Fundamentals of Computer Science (CSC 101).29 The department's general description mentions research interests in developing new statistical methodology and software development.30 Graduate-level statistics courses (e.g., STAT 543 Advanced Design and Analysis of Experiments, STAT 545 Applied Stochastic Processes) are listed, indicating advanced offerings.31

For students aspiring to conduct advanced interdisciplinary research, such as developing novel AI algorithms for complex environmental modeling, the pathway might involve careful navigation. While the MSESM offers a strong environmental science foundation and flexibility through electives, achieving deep computational proficiency might require substantial coursework from CSSE or Statistics. In some cases, a dual-major approach, a co-advised thesis bridging departments, or pursuing an MS in a computational field (like CS or Statistics) and then applying those skills to environmental research could be viable strategies. The success of the MSESM in producing graduates with strong computational capabilities hinges on the breadth and accessibility of relevant advanced computational electives from other departments and the availability of NRES faculty who can mentor and supervise computationally intensive research projects.

**D. Interdisciplinary Minors and Specializations**

Cal Poly SLO offers several interdisciplinary minors that provide students with pathways to combine knowledge from different fields, including natural sciences and computational methods:

* Cross Disciplinary Studies Minor in Data Science: This minor is a collaborative effort between the Computer Science and Statistics departments.3 It aims to equip students with foundational skills in data science, covering data gathering, organization, summarization, and communication from various data sources. The minor is described as being optimized for Statistics and Computer Science majors.9 The curriculum listed in the catalog 21 is extensive, including courses such as CSC/CPE 101, 202, 203, CSC 365 (Databases), CSC 466 (Knowledge Discovery from Data), DATA 301 (Introduction to Data Science), DATA 401 (Data Science Process and Ethics), DATA 402 (Mathematical Foundations of Data Science), STAT 302/312, STAT 331 (Statistical Computing with R), STAT 334 (Applied Linear Models), and STAT 419 (Applied Multivariate Statistics). A grade of B- or better in DATA 301 is required before applying for the minor.9  
  The prerequisites for DATA 301 are CPE/CSC 202 (Data Structures) and one of STAT 302, STAT 312, or STAT 313.29 Given that CPE/CSC 202 itself requires CPE/CSC 101 (Fundamentals of Computer Science) 33, students from NRES majors (whose core curricula typically do not include these foundational CS courses) would need to undertake significant prerequisite coursework. This prerequisite chain (CSC 101 → CSC 202 → DATA 301\) necessitates early and careful academic planning for NRES students wishing to pursue this minor, potentially posing a barrier to broader adoption if not addressed through advising or alternative pathways.  
* **Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Minor:** This interdisciplinary minor focuses on GIS, GPS, and orthophotography for resource management.4 The **Geographic Information Systems for Agriculture Minor**, coordinated by Dr. Samantha Gill 20, has a curriculum that includes BRAE 150 (Design Graphics and CAD), BRAE 239 (Engineering Surveying), BRAE 345 (Aerial Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing) or GEOG 328 (Applications in Remote Sensing and GIS), NR/LA 218 (Introduction to GIS) or GEOG 218 (Applications in GIS), and NR 418 (Applied GIS) or GEOG 441 (Advanced Applications in Geospatial Technologies). Students also choose an emphasis area such as Environmental Information or Precision Agriculture.21 This minor appears well-structured to provide applied GIS skills relevant to natural resources and agriculture.  
* **Other Relevant NRES Minors:** The NRES department also offers several other minors that allow for specialization, including the **Water Science Minor** (emphasizing irrigation, water policy, or watershed management), **Environmental Soil Science Minor**, **Land Rehabilitation Minor**, **Rangeland Resources Minor**, **Fire Ecology and Wildfire Hazard Planning Minor**, and the **Indigenous Studies in Natural Resources & the Environment Minor**.4 While these minors provide depth in specific NRES areas, their inherent computational focus may vary, though GIS and data analysis principles can be applied within many of them.

The availability of these minors, particularly in Data Science and GIS, demonstrates Cal Poly SLO's commitment to providing interdisciplinary training. However, the accessibility of the Data Science minor for students outside of CS and Statistics warrants attention. Streamlining prerequisite pathways or developing introductory data science courses tailored for domain scientists could enhance the uptake of these valuable skills by students in natural resource and environmental science programs.

**Table 2: Key Interdisciplinary Minors and Certificates**

| Minor/Certificate Name | Offering Department(s)/College(s) | Core Focus | Key Required Courses (Illustrative) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Cross Disciplinary Studies Minor in Data Science | Computer Science (CENG) & Statistics (COSAM) | Data science, programming, statistical modeling, machine learning | DATA 301 (Intro to Data Science), CSC 202 (Data Structures), STAT 302/312/313 (Statistics), CSC 466 (Knowledge Discovery), STAT 331 (R Programming), STAT 419 (Multivariate Stats) |
| Geographic Information Systems for Agriculture Minor | NRES (CAFES), BioResource & Ag Engineering (CAFES), et al. | GIS, remote sensing, spatial analysis for agriculture & environment | NR/LA 218 (Intro to GIS), BRAE 345 (Remote Sensing), NR 418 (Applied GIS) |
| Water Science Minor | NRES (CAFES), et al. | Irrigation, water policy, watershed management | Varies by emphasis; likely includes hydrology, policy, and potentially GIS courses. |
| Fire Ecology and Wildfire Hazard Planning Minor | NRES (CAFES) | Wildfire science, fuels management, fire behavior, planning | Likely includes courses on fire ecology, fire behavior (e.g., NR 308), GIS. |

## **III. Advanced Computational Curriculum: AI, ML, HPC, and Data Science**

A critical component of preparing students for modern challenges in natural resource management and environmental science is access to and training in advanced computational techniques. This section examines the offerings in AI, ML, HPC, and data science primarily from the Computer Science, Statistics, and Engineering departments, and analyzes their accessibility to students from natural resource disciplines.

**A. Course Offerings in Computer Science, Statistics, and Engineering**

Cal Poly SLO provides a range of advanced computational courses, predominantly through the CSSE and Statistics departments.

* **Computer Science (CSC/CPE):**  
  * **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML):** The CSSE department offers a sequence of AI/ML courses. Foundational is **CSC 480 Artificial Intelligence**, which requires CSC/CPE 202 (Data Structures) as a prerequisite.10 This is followed by **CSC 481 Knowledge Based Systems** (prerequisite: CSC 480).10 For deep learning, **CSC 487 Deep Learning** is available, requiring CSC 349 (Design and Analysis of Algorithms) and linear algebra (MATH 206 or MATH 244).10 Graduate-level studies include **CSC 580 Artificial Intelligence** (prerequisite: CSC 480\) and **CSC 587 Advanced Deep Learning** (prerequisite: CSC 487 or DATA 402).10 The undergraduate Computer Science major allows students to focus on AI through technical electives, and the "Learn by Doing" philosophy is applied to programming AI problems.8 Cal Poly SLO also formally offers an **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning concentration** within its Computer Science major.35  
  * **High-Performance Computing (HPC):** Courses relevant to HPC include **CSC 364 Introduction to Networked, Distributed, and Parallel Computing** (prerequisite: CSC/CPE 203 Project-Based Object-Oriented Programming).10 Operating systems courses like **CSC 453 Introduction to Operating Systems** (prerequisites including CSC/CPE 357 Systems Programming) and **CSC 454 Implementation of Operating Systems** are also foundational.10 **CSC 469 Distributed Systems** (prerequisite: CSC/CPE 357\) further covers this area.10 At the graduate level, courses like **CSC 515 Computer Architecture**, **CSC 564 Computer Networks: Research Topics**, and **CSC 569 Distributed Computing** provide advanced knowledge.10  
  * **Data Science/Analytics (from a CS perspective):** Database knowledge is built through **CSC 365 Introduction to Database Systems** (prerequisites include discrete structures or foundational CS courses plus discrete math) and **CSC 366 Database Modeling, Design and Implementation**.10 **CSC 466 Knowledge Discovery from Data** (Data Mining) requires CSC 349 and a statistics course (e.g., STAT 302, 312).10 **CSC 477 Scientific and Information Visualization** (prerequisite: CSC 349\) and **CSC 482 Speech and Language Processing** (prerequisite: CSC 466 or CSC 480\) are also offered.10 Graduate courses include **CSC 560 Database Systems** and **CSC 566 Topics in Advanced Data Mining**.10  
* **Statistics (STAT) & Data Science (DATA):**  
  * The Statistics Department and the interdisciplinary Data Science program offer crucial courses. Key statistics courses that serve as prerequisites for DATA 301 (Introduction to Data Science) include **STAT 302 Statistics II** (prerequisite: STAT 301\) 29, **STAT 312 Statistical Methods for Engineers** (prerequisite: MATH 142 Calculus II) 13, or **STAT 313 Applied Experimental Design and Regression Models** (prerequisite: an earlier STAT course like STAT 217/218/312).38  
  * The BS Statistics curriculum emphasizes applied methods, theory, and computational thinking, including coding with R and SAS.14 Specific courses include **STAT 331 Statistical Computing with R** and **STAT 334 Applied Linear Models**.21 More advanced offerings include **STAT 419 Applied Multivariate Statistics** 21 and **STAT 434 Statistical Learning: Methods and Applications**.31  
  * The **DATA**\-prefixed courses form the core of the Data Science minor. **DATA 301 Introduction to Data Science** (prerequisites: CPE/CSC 202 and STAT 302/312/313) covers various data types, including tabular, textual, temporal, and geospatial data.29 This is followed by **DATA 401 Data Science Process and Ethics** (prerequisites: DATA 301, CSC 365, CSC 466), **DATA 402 Mathematical Foundations of Data Science** (prerequisites: CSC 466, DATA 301, STAT 334), and **DATA 403 Data Science Projects Laboratory** (concurrent with DATA 401, 402).29  
* **Engineering (General):** The College of Engineering supports the Summer Undergraduate Research Program (SURP), which has featured projects involving AI for code generation (MATLAB, Python, ChatGPT), robustification of ML models against adversarial attacks, and ML for detecting anomalies in 3D printing using acoustic signals.41 These projects provide applied learning opportunities in AI/ML for engineering students.

**B. Analysis of Prerequisites and Accessibility for Natural Resource Students**

A significant consideration is the accessibility of these advanced computational courses for students majoring in natural resources, environmental science, or agriculture. Advanced CS courses, which form the backbone of AI, ML, and HPC education, typically have a sequence of prerequisites starting with fundamental programming (CSC/CPE 101), data structures (CSC/CPE 202), object-oriented programming (CSC/CPE 203), and often algorithms (CSC 349\) and systems programming (CSC/CPE 357).10

NRES students, whose curricula prioritize domain-specific science courses 4, generally do not take this extensive sequence of CS courses as part of their standard major requirements. Consequently, direct enrollment in upper-division CS courses like CSC 480 (AI) or CSC 487 (Deep Learning) would necessitate substantial additional coursework, effectively requiring them to complete a significant portion of a CS minor or many electives.

Even the gateway course to the Data Science minor, **DATA 301 Introduction to Data Science**, requires CPE/CSC 202 (Data Structures) as a prerequisite.29 Since CSC 202 itself requires CSC 101 33, an NRES student would need to complete at least these two foundational CS courses before embarking on the data science curriculum. This "prerequisite wall" can be a substantial hurdle, demanding early planning and potentially extending the time to graduation if not carefully integrated.

Courses within the Statistics department, particularly those focused on applied statistical learning (e.g., STAT 434), might present a more accessible pathway if their prerequisites align more closely with the mathematics (calculus, possibly linear algebra) and introductory/intermediate statistics courses (like STAT 218, STAT 302\) that NRES students are more likely to complete. However, even advanced STAT courses that are part of the Data Science minor, such as STAT 419 (Applied Multivariate Statistics), are embedded within a structure that also includes CS prerequisites for other components of that minor.21

This situation presents a "computational bridge" challenge. While NRES students receive valuable foundational training in GIS and applied statistics, accessing the *advanced* computational skillsets in AI, ML, HPC, and comprehensive data science offered by the CSSE department requires navigating a demanding prerequisite tree. The Cross Disciplinary Studies Minor in Data Science is designed to create such a bridge, but its own prerequisite load from Computer Science makes it a significant commitment for students not already in CS or Statistics. This suggests a systemic need to consider alternative pathways for students in domain sciences. Potential solutions could include:

1. Developing specialized "AI/ML for Domain Scientists" or "Data Science for Environmental Applications" courses that have prerequisites more aligned with natural science curricula (e.g., focusing on applied programming in Python/R and statistics, rather than deep CS theory). Cal Poly Pomona, for instance, is noted to be developing a "Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Certificate for Non-CS Majors" 42, which exemplifies such an approach.  
2. Creating clearer, more streamlined, and officially recognized "computational tracks" or "emphases" within NRES majors that strategically incorporate necessary foundational CS and Stats courses from an early stage.  
3. Embedding more sophisticated computational modules and data analysis techniques directly within existing upper-division NRES courses, taught by NRES faculty with computational expertise or in collaboration with CS/Stats faculty.

Without such mechanisms, there is a risk that many talented natural resource students may not acquire the advanced computational skills increasingly necessary for cutting-edge research and practice in their fields, or that only a small, self-selected group will undertake the extra burden to do so.

**Table 3: Selected Advanced Courses in AI, ML, HPC, and Data Science**

## **IV. Faculty Expertise and Interdisciplinary Research Synergies**

The successful application of computational methods to natural resource and environmental challenges hinges on faculty expertise within relevant departments and the existence of robust interdisciplinary collaborations.

**A. Profiles in Natural Resources & Environmental Sciences with Computational/Data Focus**

The NRES department at Cal Poly SLO possesses a core group of faculty whose research actively incorporates computational tools, particularly in geospatial analysis and quantitative modeling:

* **Dr. Aakash Ahamed** focuses on remote sensing, hydrogeophysics, and agroforestry. His research plans include supervising Master's students using remote sensing technologies and geospatial data science to understand water and carbon cycles. He also hires undergraduate researchers for hydrology and biomass GIS work, indicating a direct application of these computational skills.43  
* **Dr. Yiwen Chiu** specializes in environmental management, the application of GIS, life-cycle analysis (LCA), and quantitative simulation. Dr. Chiu intends to support Master's students in research on the LCA of agricultural practices and the geospatial implications of greenhouse gas emissions associated with land use change, and also engages undergraduates in LCA research.43 Publications attributed to Dr. Chiu (some with May Wu) cover topics like the water footprint of biofuels, biorefinery sizing, and environmental sustainability impacts, often involving modeling and quantitative assessment.6  
* **Dr. Christopher Surfleet** conducts research on stream-aquifer connectivity, classification of fire-caused tree mortality using digital orthophotography and LiDAR, the effects of climate change on rain-on-snow peak flow events, and broader watershed hydrology and sediment yield modeling.6 This work clearly demonstrates the use of geospatial data and sophisticated hydrological modeling.  
* **Dr. Brian D. Bishop** has collaborated on research involving the classification of plot-level fire-caused tree mortality in redwood forests using digital orthophotography and LiDAR, showcasing expertise in geospatial analysis for forest science.6  
* **Dr. Marc Horney** leads the **NRES Geospatial Systems Lab**. His research centers on rangeland ecology and management, utilizing LiDAR technology to create detailed 3D virtual representations of complex landscapes, with a current focus on fire-prone ecosystems and applications like mapping creek obstructions for flood mitigation.44 The lab is equipped with drones, total stations, GNSS survey systems, and professional photogrammetry software, providing students with hands-on training in remote pilot certification, aerial survey planning, and LiDAR/survey data preprocessing.44 Dr. Horney is also involved in WUI Fire Institute projects focusing on UAV capture of fuel characteristics using LiDAR and hyperspectral imaging.45

The NRES department's general research mission emphasizes ethical and data-driven sustainable management, protection, and restoration of land resources.6 The faculty profiles and lab activities reveal a significant strength and ongoing research activity in geospatial technologies (GIS, various forms of remote sensing including LiDAR and UAV-based systems, GPS) and quantitative modeling. These tools are being applied to critical areas such as hydrology, fire science, forest management, and ecosystem assessment. While AI and ML applications are less explicitly detailed in these specific faculty profiles compared to geospatial methods, Dr. Ahamed's mention of "geospatial data science" 43 suggests an emerging integration of more advanced data analytics, potentially including ML techniques, with spatial data. This strong foundation in geospatial data acquisition and analysis provides a fertile ground for the future incorporation of more sophisticated AI/ML approaches.

**B. Profiles in Computer Science & Statistics with Environmental/Natural Resource Applications**

Expertise in advanced computational methods resides primarily in the CSSE and Statistics departments, with several faculty members whose research interests have potential or existing links to environmental and natural resource applications:

* **Computer Science and Software Engineering (CSSE) Faculty:**  
  * **Dr. Paul Anderson** lists AI, machine learning, bioinformatics, data science, genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics among his interests.46 These areas have strong potential applications in ecological genomics, environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis, and modeling biological responses to environmental change.  
  * **Dr. Fahim Khan's** work in computer vision, applied machine learning, data visualization, and citizen science is directly relevant.46 These skills can be applied to analyzing environmental imagery (e.g., from drones or camera traps), developing ML models for ecological monitoring, and engaging the public in environmental data collection efforts.  
  * **Dr. Sumona Mukhopadhyay** focuses on data science, machine learning, object detection, and OpenCV.46 This expertise is highly applicable to analyzing remote sensing data for land cover classification, tracking wildlife from images or video, and identifying environmental features or anomalies.  
  * **Dr. Jonathan Ventura's** research in computer vision, machine learning, augmented/virtual reality, and remote sensing offers significant potential for collaboration on environmental remote sensing projects, developing new analytical techniques for satellite or aerial imagery, or creating immersive visualizations of environmental data.46  
  * Beyond these specific areas, general CSSE expertise in databases, distributed computing, and software engineering is fundamental for developing and managing the large-scale data platforms and modeling frameworks increasingly used in environmental science.  
* **Statistics Department Faculty:**  
  * The Statistics Department states that a significant part of its research and scholarship involves "collaborating with researchers in a variety of fields" and runs a **statistical consulting service** to assist faculty and student researchers across campus.30 This service acts as a crucial potential bridge, providing statistical expertise to environmental research projects.  
  * **Dr. Sinem Demirci**, a lecturer in the Statistics department, lists research interests that include Data Science Education, Statistics Education, and notably, **Environmental and Sustainability Education**.47 This direct interest in the pedagogical aspects of applying data science and statistics to environmental and sustainability topics is a valuable asset for fostering interdisciplinary understanding and training.  
  * The department's mission includes increasing statistical literacy across Cal Poly and fostering collaboration 30, which aligns well with the needs of data-intensive environmental research.  
* **Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEENVE) Faculty:**  
  * Faculty within CEENVE, such as **Dr. Tryg Lundquist**, whose research includes natural wastewater treatment technologies, evaluation of algae-to-biofuel processes, and water quality issues 12, likely employ computational modeling and data analysis in their work, though specific AI/ML applications are not detailed in the provided snippets. Other faculty in water resources engineering and geoenvironmental engineering also contribute to computational approaches in environmental contexts.11

While significant computational expertise exists in CSSE and Statistics, and applied environmental modeling occurs in CEENVE, the extent to which this expertise is systematically and collaboratively applied to natural resource and environmental challenges appears to be an area with considerable growth potential. The Statistics department's consulting service provides a mechanism for collaboration, and some CSSE faculty have research areas (like Dr. Ventura in remote sensing or Dr. Khan in computer vision for citizen science) that align well. However, the provided information does not prominently feature large-scale, formally established, and funded joint research programs or interdisciplinary research groups specifically themed around "AI for Environmental Science" or "Computational Ecology" that are co-led by NRES and CSSE/Statistics faculty. This suggests that while individual collaborations likely occur, there is an opportunity to institutionalize and scale up these interdisciplinary research efforts to tackle more complex environmental problems with advanced computational tools.

**C. Emerging and Established Cross-Departmental Research Collaborations**

Several structures and initiatives at Cal Poly SLO facilitate or exemplify cross-departmental collaboration at the intersection of natural sciences and computation:

* **Interdisciplinary Minors:** The **Cross Disciplinary Studies Minor in Data Science**, jointly offered by the Computer Science and Statistics departments 9, and the various **GIS Minors** involving NRES and other departments 4, represent formal academic collaborations that foster cross-training.  
* **Swanton Pacific Ranch:** This extensive field station not only supports NRES research but also facilitates inter-institutional collaborations, such as the project with Stanford University on smoke sensor data collection during prescribed burns.48 Its rich datasets (LiDAR, forest inventory, climate data) are a valuable resource for collaborative research.49  
* **Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) Fire Institute:** This institute explicitly "leverages faculty, staff, and students from across all six Colleges to educate, train and solve complex problems through an interdisciplinary, solutions-oriented approach".50 Its projects bring together fire ecologists (NRES), engineers, chemists, city planners, and other disciplines, with examples including Dr. Marc Horney's (NRES) work on UAV-based fuel characterization and Dr. Chris Dicus's (NRES) development of a Fire Science minor.45  
* **Digital Transformation Hub (DxHub):** This university-wide initiative, powered by AWS, is a significant catalyst for interdisciplinary projects. It brings together students and faculty from various departments to work on real-world challenges posed by external partners (e.g., USDA, CalFire, World Bank), often involving AI, ML, and data analytics.51

These examples—interdisciplinary academic programs, research-intensive field stations and institutes, and challenge-driven innovation hubs—serve as existing models for fostering collaboration. The WUI Fire Institute and the DxHub, in particular, demonstrate successful frameworks for bringing diverse expertise to bear on complex problems. The ongoing challenge and opportunity lie in broadening such deep collaborations beyond specific projects or institutes into more sustained, programmatic research efforts that systematically pair the domain expertise and data from CAFES/NRES with the advanced computational methodologies from CENG/COSAM. While these hubs are excellent, fostering a broader culture and more numerous instances of faculty-level joint research ventures could further amplify Cal Poly SLO's impact in computational environmental science.

**Table 4: Illustrative Faculty Expertise at the Intersection of Domains**

| Faculty Research Theme/Area | Key Departments Involved | Examples of Faculty Research Focus/Methods (Generalized) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Geospatial Data Science for Water & Carbon Cycles | NRES | Application of remote sensing (satellite, aerial), GIS, and emerging data science techniques to monitor and model hydrological processes, biomass, and carbon dynamics in various ecosystems (e.g., agroforestry, watersheds). 43 |
| AI/Computer Vision for Environmental Remote Sensing | CSSE, NRES (potential collaborator) | Development and application of machine learning and computer vision algorithms for analyzing remote sensing imagery (satellite, drone, LiDAR, hyperspectral) for land cover change, object detection (e.g., wildlife), and environmental feature extraction. 44 |

## **V. Research Computing Infrastructure and Resources**

The capacity for computationally intensive research in natural resources, environmental science, and AI/ML applications is significantly dependent on the availability and accessibility of robust research computing infrastructure, including High-Performance Computing (HPC) clusters, Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), relevant software stacks, and adequate user support.

**A. High-Performance Computing (HPC) Capabilities and GPU Availability**

Information regarding Cal Poly SLO's central HPC resources specific to the San Luis Obispo campus indicates an initiative from several years ago. In 2017, a team of seven Cal Poly engineering professors secured Silicon Mechanics' sixth annual equipment grant, which brought new HPC technologies to campus. This grant, valued at over $130,000, provided an HPC "cluster" with high-performance processing, networking, storage, and crucially, **Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) technologies**. This system was described at the time as the "first dedicated cluster on campus" and was intended to support a range of research areas, including computational fluid dynamics, fire dynamics, deep visual learning, and cybersecurity, benefiting both undergraduate project teams and graduate student research.54

However, current, detailed specifications of this 2017 cluster—such as its processing power (CPU/GPU types and counts), memory, storage capacity, interconnect technology, and current operational status or upgrade history—are not readily available in the provided documentation. For context, Cal Poly Pomona's HPC cluster, as detailed in 2024, includes two management nodes, 20 compute nodes, and four GPU nodes equipped with 8 Tesla P100 GPUs, 3.3TB of RAM, and an Infiniband interconnect, managed by Slurm.55 This provides a benchmark of what a sister CSU campus offers but does not describe the current state at SLO.

The absence of up-to-date public information on a central, university-wide HPC/GPU resource at Cal Poly SLO is a notable gap. This lack of clarity makes it difficult to assess the on-campus capacity for large-scale computational tasks common in modern AI/ML and environmental modeling. It is possible that HPC resources are decentralized (i.e., department- or lab-specific), that the 2017 cluster has aged without significant upgrades being publicly detailed, or that researchers increasingly rely on external resources.

Indeed, there is evidence of Cal Poly SLO researchers leveraging national supercomputing facilities. For instance, a research team from Cal Poly SLO utilized an NSF ACCESS allocation on the National Center for Supercomputing Applications' (NCSA) Delta system, which includes GPUs, for an AI project focused on training a diffusion model.57 While use of national resources is common and beneficial for highly demanding computations, significant reliance on them can also indicate limitations or oversubscription of local campus resources.

GPU technology itself is a subject of research at Cal Poly SLO. A 2022 Master's thesis in Electrical Engineering from Cal Poly SLO detailed work on accelerating graphics rendering on RISC-V GPUs, including the implementation of fixed function graphics hardware.58 This suggests campus expertise in GPU architecture and development.

Overall, while an initial investment in HPC with GPU capabilities was made at SLO in 2017, the current state, capacity, and centralized accessibility of these resources for broad research use, particularly for AI/ML in natural resources, remain unclear from the available information. This ambiguity is significant for researchers needing local, readily accessible high-performance computing.

**B. Supported AI/ML Software Stacks and Data Analytics Tools**

Cal Poly SLO provides access to a variety of software relevant to data analysis, GIS, and potentially AI/ML development, primarily through the Cal Poly Software Hub and virtualized environments:

* **General Software Access:** The Cal Poly Software Hub is the primary portal for students, faculty, and staff to download free and site-licensed software applications for Windows and Mac devices.59 This hub also provides access to **Virtual Computer Labs (AppStream)**, enabling users to work with various academic software tools through a web browser.59  
* **Statistical Software:** **JMP** statistical software is available for download via the Software Hub.60 The **SAS University Edition**, a free full version for non-commercial academic use, is also accessible.60 The programming language **R** is integral to statistics education (e.g., STAT 331 Statistical Computing with R 21) and is widely used in the BS Statistics program.14  
* **GIS Software:** **ArcGIS Pro** is available either for download and local installation or for use via the ITS Virtual Lab (AppStream). **ArcGIS Online** accounts are also provided, accessible using Cal Poly Single Sign On.60 ArcGIS is the platform used in the introductory GIS course NR 218\.18  
* **Data Visualization Tools:** **Tableau Public** and the **Tableau Desktop Student Edition** are available, along with free training resources.60  
* **Engineering and CAD Software:** Tools like **SolidWorks** and a suite of **Autodesk software** (e.g., Revit, Maya) are accessible to students and faculty.60  
* **AI/ML Development Environments and Libraries:**  
  * **Python** and **R** are standard languages for AI/ML and data science. Python is mentioned in the context of CENG SURP projects involving AI code generation.41 The Anaconda package management system, which simplifies the management of Python/R environments and libraries, is noted as being used on the Cal Poly Pomona HPC cluster 56, suggesting familiarity within the CSU system.  
  * Specific deep learning libraries such as **TensorFlow** and **PyTorch** are not explicitly listed as centrally provided or supported software titles in the Cal Poly SLO documentation. However, these are commonly installed and managed by researchers and students within their Python environments (e.g., via Anaconda or pip).  
  * The **Digital Transformation Hub (DxHub)** utilizes Amazon Web Services (AWS) for its projects, including **Amazon Bedrock** which provides access to foundation models like Anthropic Claude for generative AI applications.52 This indicates that cloud-based AI platforms and tools are being used for specific research and development initiatives.

Cal Poly SLO appears to follow a model where standard commercial software for key areas like GIS and statistics is provided centrally, while reliance for AI/ML development is likely on researchers and students installing and managing common open-source packages (primarily Python libraries) within flexible environments. While this approach is common, dedicated centralized support or pre-configured environments for advanced AI/ML software stacks beyond base Python/R installations are not detailed in the provided information. Access to cloud-based AI services, as demonstrated by the DxHub, offers another avenue for utilizing advanced AI tools.

**C. Access Policies and Support for Researchers and Students**

Access to software and computing resources is generally governed by an individual's role at Cal Poly:

* Software available through the Cal Poly Software Hub is determined by eligibility criteria for students, faculty, and staff.59 Tech Rentals of computer equipment are also available.60  
* The **ITS Service Desk** serves as the primary point of contact for general technology support, including basic troubleshooting, hardware and software assistance, and consultation on ITS services like Cal Poly accounts, WiFi, and printing.61 The College of Science and Mathematics also directs its members to the ITS Service Desk for technical assistance.62  
* The **Office of Student Research**, newly formed, aims to increase student participation in research, enhance transparency of access to research opportunities, and support both student researchers and their faculty mentors.63

Regarding access to the Cal Poly SLO HPC cluster established in 2017 54, specific current access policies, application procedures, queueing systems, user support mechanisms, and dedicated training programs are not clearly outlined in the available documentation. While the initial grant emphasized broad student and researcher access, the operational details for leveraging these resources for computationally intensive tasks like AI model training or large-scale environmental simulations are not evident. This contrasts with Cal Poly Pomona, which provides a faculty guide, student handbook, and a support request system for its HPC resources.56 The lack of such readily available information for SLO's central HPC resources is a critical point for assessing their practical usability by the wider research community, including those in NRES.

**D. Specialized AI and Data-Intensive Research Labs**

Beyond any central computing resources, specialized labs and initiatives play a key role in providing access to advanced tools and expertise:

* **Digital Transformation Hub (DxHub):** As previously noted, the DxHub, powered by AWS, is a significant entity for applied AI development.51 It focuses on solving public sector challenges using cloud innovation methodologies and technologies, actively involving students in these projects. Its use of generative AI tools like Anthropic Claude on Amazon Bedrock, serverless architectures (AWS Lambda), and modern front-end frameworks (React) highlights its capacity for cutting-edge AI work.52 The DxHub appears to be a primary campus resource for accessing advanced cloud-based AI tools and expertise, particularly for externally partnered, project-based initiatives.  
* **NRES Geospatial Systems Lab:** Led by Professor Marc Horney, this lab is dedicated to advanced geospatial data acquisition and analysis. It utilizes LiDAR, drones, GNSS survey systems, and professional photogrammetry software for research in areas like fire-prone ecosystems, watershed management, and biomass estimation, providing crucial hands-on training for NRES students.44 This lab is vital for NRES-specific data-intensive research.  
* **Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) FIRE Institute:** This institute conducts multidisciplinary research that includes fuels monitoring and ecosystem responses, often utilizing technology, engineering, and data analysis.45 Dr. Horney's UAV and LiDAR work for fuels analysis is linked to the WUI Institute's activities 45, demonstrating the application of data-intensive methods to wildfire science.

These specialized labs and hubs provide critical infrastructure and expertise that may not be available at a general university computing level. The DxHub, in particular, seems to be a key enabler for sophisticated AI projects, especially those requiring scalable cloud resources or access to specific large language models. For high-resolution geospatial data acquisition and analysis relevant to natural resources, the NRES Geospatial Systems Lab is a central asset.

## **VI. Strategic Vision: AI, Data Science, and Environmental Stewardship**

The strategic direction of Cal Poly SLO and its constituent colleges provides the overarching framework for initiatives related to computational research, interdisciplinary collaboration, and environmental stewardship.

**A. University-Level Strategic Priorities for Computational Research and Interdisciplinarity**

Cal Poly SLO's university-wide strategic plan, as articulated by President Armstrong, outlines several key priorities and guiding principles that are relevant to the integration of computational methods and interdisciplinary approaches.64 The plan focuses on people (student and faculty success), programs (campus culture, academic portfolio, community), and support infrastructure (data/technology, finances/facilities/systems).  
Key strategic priorities include:

* **Leverage Data and Technology to Support the Institution's Mission:** This priority directly signals an intent to utilize data-driven and technological approaches across the university's functions, including education and research.  
* Enhance the Success of All Cal Poly Students, ensuring they attain the knowledge, skills, and understanding to thrive in a diverse, evolving, and competitive environment.  
* Cultivate the Excellence of our Faculty and Staff.  
* Strengthen our Portfolio of Academic Programs.

The plan is anchored by founding and guiding principles: **Learn by Doing**, Student Success, Excellence Through Continuous Improvement, and being a Comprehensive Polytechnic State University.64 The "Learn by Doing" philosophy is particularly pertinent, as it encourages active engagement with tools and techniques, including computational ones.

The Administration & Finance (A\&F) Strategic Plan further reinforces a commitment to sustainability with its sixth strategic direction: "Make sustainability a core part of Cal Poly and A\&F culture." This includes goals related to carbon neutrality, climate resilience, water use efficiency, and improved waste management.65

Collectively, the university's strategic plans create a supportive environment for the application of data-intensive and computational methods to solve complex problems. The emphasis on leveraging data and technology, preparing students for a competitive technological landscape, and a strong commitment to sustainability provide an implicit endorsement for initiatives that might involve AI, data science, and computational modeling in fields like environmental science and natural resource management. However, these high-level university strategies do not typically detail specific investments or programs for "AI research in environmental science," for example; such specifics are usually elaborated at the college or departmental level or through targeted research initiatives. The university plan provides the enabling vision, but the implementation of how data and technology are leveraged for specific research domains often rests with the colleges.

**B. College-Specific (CAFES, CENG) Strategic Plans: Alignment with AI/Data Science and Environmental/Natural Resource Goals**

The strategic plans of the colleges most relevant to this analysis—CAFES and CENG—offer more specific insights into their priorities regarding computational methods and environmental applications.

* College of Agriculture, Food and Environmental Sciences (CAFES):  
  CAFES's mission is to foster teaching, scholarship, and service in a "Learn by Doing" environment, positioning itself as a global leader in undergraduate agricultural education with degrees in sustainable agriculture, food systems, and environmental and life sciences.66  
  The CAFES 2023-26 Strategic Priorities outline five key areas: Student Success, Social Impact, Faculty & Staff Success, Investment in Facilities and Infrastructure, and External Stakeholder Engagement.67 A particularly relevant priority under Social Impact is to "Move college firmly into the climate smart food production and environmental sustainability space".68  
  While this priority strongly implies the need for data-intensive approaches, modeling, and potentially AI (e.g., for precision agriculture, climate impact assessment, sustainable resource management), the summary of the strategic priorities document 68 indicates that it does not explicitly mention Artificial Intelligence (AI), data science, or computational research as specific strategies or tools to achieve these environmental and sustainability goals. The focus is on the outcomes (climate-smart production, sustainability), with the methods to achieve them being less explicitly defined in terms of advanced computation in this high-level outline.  
* College of Engineering (CENG):  
  The CENG 2023-2028 Strategic Plan reaffirms its commitment to "Learn by Doing" while adding a focus on creativity, innovation, sustainability, and making a positive impact on society. It also integrates Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (JEDI) into its core mission, vision, and goals.69  
  Under the strategic priority of Excelling in Teaching and Scholarship, CENG aims to:  
  * Expand "Learn by Doing" activities and infrastructure, with an emphasis on cross-disciplinary opportunities that support curricular and co-curricular threads on **societal challenges, data literacy, systems thinking,** ethics, and JEDI.70 Actions include integrating these curricular thread topics (such as data literacy) into required course curricula and expanding interdisciplinary collaborations.  
  * Increase support for the teacher-scholar model by creating and promoting faculty and student research opportunities, including building active research communities on topics such as **engineering education research, climate change, and sustainability**.70

CENG's strategic plan demonstrates a more explicit commitment to integrating computational concepts like "data literacy" and "systems thinking" directly into its curriculum. The support for research on societal challenges and sustainability, coupled with an emphasis on interdisciplinary collaboration, creates a strong mandate for applying engineering and computational expertise to environmental problems.

Comparing the two college plans, CENG appears to be more overtly focused on developing the foundational computational skillsets (like data literacy) and research approaches applicable to broad societal issues, including sustainability. CAFES, on the other hand, is highly focused on the domain-specific outcomes related to agriculture and environmental sustainability. This difference highlights a critical interdependency: CAFES possesses the domain expertise, the "living laboratories" like Swanton Pacific Ranch, and the pressing environmental and agricultural challenges, while CENG (along with COSAM's Statistics department) cultivates the advanced computational methodologies and engineering solutions. Therefore, strong and sustained partnerships between CAFES and the computational science departments in CENG and COSAM are paramount for Cal Poly SLO to effectively address complex environmental issues using cutting-edge data science, AI, and modeling techniques. While CAFES's goals inherently require such tools, making this need explicit in future strategic iterations could further drive targeted investment and collaboration.

## **VII. Flagship Research Initiatives, Centers, and External Partnerships**

Cal Poly SLO's "Learn by Doing" philosophy is vividly expressed through its various research centers, institutes, field stations, and collaborative projects that bridge academic inquiry with real-world problem-solving, many of which are pertinent to natural resources and the application of computational methods.

**A. Leading Research Centers and Institutes**

Several centers and institutes, particularly within CAFES and NRES, serve as hubs for applied research and have the potential to integrate or are already using computational and data-intensive approaches:

* **Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) Fire Institute (CAFES):** This mission-driven organization seeks solutions to the WUI fire problem through innovative research, training, and education. It aims to create safer and more fire-resilient communities by addressing issues like unsustainable vegetative fuel loading, climate change impacts, and development in fire-prone areas.50 The Institute uniquely leverages faculty, staff, and students from across all six Cal Poly colleges, fostering an interdisciplinary approach involving fire ecologists, architects, engineers, chemists, and city planners.50 Research areas include fire science and engineering, information and intelligence gathering/analysis, and multidisciplinary applied research on fuels monitoring, ecosystem responses, and the use of technology and analysis for contemporary problems.50 Specific projects include UAV capture of fuel characteristics near WUI communities using LiDAR and hyperspectral imaging, led by Dr. Marc Horney.45  
* **Center for Sustainability (CAFES):** This center aims to advance sustainable food and agriculture systems through education, demonstration of sustainable practices, investigation, and facilitation of collaborative efforts. Given its nearly 10,000 acres of land serving as a living laboratory, it is well-positioned for research that could utilize computational methods for modeling sustainable practices and analyzing large environmental datasets.71  
* **Coastal Resources Institute (CRI) (CAFES):** CRI is dedicated to resolving issues involving the management of natural resources such as land, water, timber, flora, and fauna. It provides services like management plans, habitat audits, environmental and social impact inventories and analyses, and policy planning.71 This work inherently involves data collection and analysis, where GIS, spatial modeling, and other computational tools are highly relevant.  
* **Swanton Pacific Ranch (CAFES/NRES):** This 3,200-acre property is an extensive field laboratory managed by Cal Poly, supporting research and education in sustainable agriculture, forestry, watershed management, and rangeland studies.4 The ranch maintains significant datasets, including multiple airborne LiDAR surveys, a Continuous Forest Inventory (CFI) with plot measurements dating back to 1997, real-time stream gauge data (height and temperature), and data from USDA-NRCS soil climate stations monitoring soil temperature, moisture, air temperature, and precipitation.49 These rich, longitudinal datasets make Swanton Pacific Ranch an invaluable asset for data-intensive environmental research and a prime location for applying AI/ML techniques for ecological forecasting, change detection, and resource management optimization. It also hosts inter-institutional collaborations, such as work with Stanford University on smoke sensor deployment and data collection during prescribed burns.48  
* **NRES Geospatial Systems Lab (NRES/CAFES):** Led by Dr. Marc Horney, this lab specializes in the use of LiDAR, drones, GNSS survey systems, and photogrammetry software for research focused on fire-prone ecosystems, watershed management, and landscape-level biomass estimation. It provides critical hands-on training for students in advanced geospatial data acquisition and processing techniques.44  
* **Center for Coastal Marine Sciences (CCMS) (University-wide):** CCMS conducts research aimed at enhancing marine life, protecting coastal habitats, and adapting to climate change. It operates a 3,000-foot research pier in Avila Beach, providing unparalleled access to the ocean for fieldwork and research.72 This center is another potential area for data-intensive marine environmental science.  
* **Other CAFES Centers:** The **Strawberry Center** (applied research in plant pathology, entomology, automation), **The Grimm Family Center for Organic Production and Research** (organic soils, plant nutrition, pest management), and the **Urban Forest Ecosystems Institute (UFEI)** (management of urban forests) also conduct applied research that could benefit from or already incorporates data analysis and computational methods.4

These centers and field stations underscore Cal Poly's commitment to applied research that addresses pressing environmental and agricultural challenges. The WUI Fire Institute and Swanton Pacific Ranch, in particular, stand out for their direct relevance to natural resource management and their existing use or potential for leveraging advanced computational tools and large datasets. The availability of rich datasets at Swanton Pacific Ranch, for example, provides a strong foundation for developing and applying AI/ML models to ecological questions.

**B. Major Externally Funded Projects (NSF, USDA) Bridging Computational Methods with Environmental/Natural Resource Applications**

Cal Poly SLO, often through its specialized centers and the DxHub, has secured external funding for projects that intersect computational methods with environmental or natural resource-related applications:

* **USDA Partnership with DxHub:** The Cal Poly Digital Transformation Hub (DxHub) partnered with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to develop an innovative generative AI chatbot solution using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to modernize and streamline IT support for USDA's extensive staff. This project, while focused on IT, supports the USDA's broader mission in agriculture, rural development, and natural resource conservation and demonstrates a significant AI collaboration with a key federal agency in these sectors.51  
* **NSF-Funded AI Research:** A Cal Poly SLO research team received an NSF ACCESS allocation to use the National Center for Supercomputing Applications' (NCSA) Delta supercomputer (which includes GPUs) to train an AI diffusion model. This project aims to predict the location of lost individuals using multimodal data.57 While the application is search and rescue, it showcases NSF-funded AI research and the use of high-performance computing resources by Cal Poly researchers.  
* **NSF Convergence Accelerator \- NOURISH Project:** Cal Poly is involved in the NOURISH project, which aims to develop an AI-enabled platform to empower small businesses in food deserts to increase fresh food production. This initiative addresses food security and market inefficiencies in the food system, which are socio-environmental issues.73  
* **WUI Fire Institute Funded Projects:** The WUI Fire Institute manages several externally funded projects 45:  
  * Funding from **CAL Fire and The Wildfire Conservancy** supports projects on firefighter PPE evaluation through metabolomic profiles (data-intensive), respirator design, non-combustible fencing evaluation, digital outreach materials, firefighter cancer risk cohort studies, and improved hose-clamp design.  
  * A **University of Montana/US Forest Service pass-through award** supports workforce development (a minor in Fire Science for the WUI), the development of a "living laboratory" in fuel treatment areas on Cal Poly property, a roadside ignition prevention study, and significantly, **UAV capture of fuel characteristics near WUI communities through LiDAR and hyperspectral imaging** (led by Dr. Marc Horney). This latter project is a clear example of advanced computational/geospatial methods applied to natural resource management.  
  * A **Gordon & Betty Moore Foundation** grant supports a project adapting a spatially-based, hazard-informed method for plan integration to improve wildfire mitigation and another project researching the long-term environmental impacts of fuel pre-treatment with retardants (on soil, water, vegetation). These involve spatial analysis and environmental impact assessment.

The DxHub and the WUI Fire Institute emerge as pivotal entities for attracting and managing externally funded projects that involve AI, data analytics, and other computational approaches relevant to environmental science and natural resource management. These institutes appear to be effective conduits for translating campus expertise into impactful, funded research programs with significant external partners.

**C. Collaborative Partnerships (Industry, Government, Inter-Institutional)**

Cal Poly SLO's "Learn by Doing" ethos is strongly reflected in its extensive network of collaborative partnerships that provide real-world context, data, funding, and application opportunities for its research and educational programs.

* **Industry Partnerships:**  
  * The **Digital Transformation Hub (DxHub)** is explicitly "powered by Amazon Web Services (AWS)" 51, indicating a deep strategic relationship with a leading cloud and AI technology provider.  
  * The **NRES Geospatial Systems Lab** has a partnership with **Inspired Flight**, a local manufacturer of unmanned aerial vehicles (drones), allowing researchers to use advanced sensor systems for landscape-level vegetation management and fire mitigation research.44  
  * The **Statistics Department** actively engages with industry, providing students with experience on real-world data projects.14  
  * The 2017 HPC grant involved **Silicon Mechanics** and its technology partners, including **Intel, Nvidia Corp., Mellanox Technologies, Supermicro**, and others.54  
* **Government Agency Partnerships:**  
  * The **DxHub** has engaged in projects with the **USDA** 51, **CalFire**, the **State of California Governor's Office of Planning and Research (OPR)**, and **Vandenberg Space Force Base**.53  
  * The **WUI Fire Institute** collaborates with **CAL Fire** and the **US Forest Service** (via a pass-through award from the University of Montana).45  
  * The **California Cybersecurity Institute (CCI)** is a partnership with the **California National Guard**.72  
  * The NRES department has program-level recognitions: Forest and Fire Sciences graduates are recognized by the **U.S. Office of Personnel Management** for federal forester positions 7, and the Environmental Management and Protection major is endorsed by the **California Association of Environmental Professionals (AEP)**.7  
* **Inter-Institutional Partnerships:**  
  * The **DxHub** has collaborated with entities like the **Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene**, **Virginia DCLS**, and extensively with **The World Bank** on various data-driven projects.53  
  * **Swanton Pacific Ranch** has research collaborations with **Stanford University**, for example, on wildfire smoke sensor deployment.48  
  * The **WUI Fire Institute** has partnerships with the **University of Montana**.45  
  * The **Food Systems Leadership Institute (FSLI)**, focusing on leadership development for food systems, is jointly hosted by The Ohio State University, North Carolina State University, and Cal Poly, with support from the W.K. Kellogg Foundation.71

These diverse partnerships demonstrate that Cal Poly SLO actively extends its "Learn by Doing" approach into its research and innovation activities. These collaborations are vital for providing students and faculty with access to real-world problems, unique datasets, funding opportunities, and avenues for impactful application of their skills, particularly in the applied computational domains facilitated by entities like the DxHub and specialized research labs.

## **VIII. Governance: AI Ethics and Responsible Conduct of Research**

As computational methods, particularly AI and data science, become more integrated into research across disciplines, establishing clear ethical guidelines and ensuring proper training in responsible conduct is crucial.

**A. University and CSU System Policies and Guidelines on AI Ethics**

Cal Poly SLO operates within the framework of the California State University (CSU) system, which is actively developing guidance on the ethical use of AI:

* **CSU System-Level Guidance:** The CSU system acknowledges its commitment to guiding the **ethical and responsible use of AI** in education. It recognizes both the opportunities and the inherent challenges associated with AI, including issues of fairness, privacy, and potential biases.74 The system encourages faculty and students to explore AI thoughtfully, balancing its benefits against its risks. While tools like ChatGPT are seen as potentially enhancing learning and research, their use must be responsible. The CSU provides **"Guidelines for Safe and Responsible Use of Generative AI Tools"** and references the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) **"Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework (AI RMF 1.0)"** as a resource for managing AI risks and promoting trustworthy development and use.74  
* **CSU AI Educational Innovations Challenge (AIEIC):** This initiative explicitly invites CSU faculty to develop projects that leverage AI while simultaneously enhancing critical thinking skills and promoting **ethical and responsible use of AI**.75 A key goal is to prepare students to be "empowered, equitable, and **ethical users**" of AI technologies. The challenge encourages proposals that involve students as partners in developing responsible and ethical AI applications and gives special consideration to projects addressing these themes, particularly using established frameworks like the Research Libraries Guiding Principles for AI.75  
* **Cal Poly SLO Implementation:** While specific, campus-wide AI ethics *policies* for research at Cal Poly SLO are not detailed in the provided snippets, the university is part of the CSU system's efforts. Practical implementation of ethical considerations is evident in projects undertaken by the DxHub. For example, the AI chatbot developed for USDA IT support incorporated **"guardrails to detect and block PII exposure as well as filter inappropriate content and language,"** demonstrating attention to privacy and responsible deployment.51

The landscape for AI ethics at Cal Poly SLO appears to be actively evolving, strongly influenced by CSU system-wide initiatives. The emphasis is on promoting responsible use, integrating ethical considerations into the curriculum, and fostering critical thinking about AI's implications. While practical safeguards are being implemented in AI development projects, the existence of a comprehensive, standalone Cal Poly SLO *research ethics policy specifically for AI* is not confirmed by the available information but may be under development or covered implicitly by broader RCR, data privacy, and security policies.

**B. Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) Training Programs (CITI) and Requirements**

Cal Poly SLO utilizes a standardized platform for delivering training on the responsible conduct of research:

* **CITI Program Usage:** The university employs the **Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI Program)** to provide training modules covering Animal Subjects, Human Subjects, and the Ethical Conduct in Research.76 CITI is a widely used platform dedicated to research ethics and compliance training for academic institutions.78  
* **NSF Mandate:** A key driver for RCR training is the National Science Foundation (NSF) requirement, stemming from the America COMPETES Act. All NSF-funded undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral scholars involved in research must receive training in the responsible conduct of research. Institutions applying for NSF funding must certify they have a training plan in place.77 Principal Investigators (PIs) are responsible for ensuring their NSF-supported trainees complete the required CITI training and must maintain documented evidence. The CITI RCR certification obtained for NSF purposes is typically valid for two years at Cal Poly SLO.77  
* **Access and Module Selection:** Individuals register with CITI and affiliate with Cal Poly SLO to access the required training modules free of charge.77 PIs are expected to communicate to their trainees which specific CITI modules must be completed to meet federal requirements, with assistance available from the Grants Development Office.77  
* **IRB and General RCR Training:** While specific requirements for Cal Poly SLO were not fully detailed, examples from sister campuses suggest common practices. Cal Poly Humboldt requires the CITI "Social & Behavioral Research \- Basic/Refresher, Basic Course" for Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval.79 Cal Poly Pomona requires CITI training for PIs and personnel on research protocols, using courses like "Basic RCR," "Responsible Conduct of Research for engineers," or "Responsible Conduct of Research for administrators," with validity typically lasting four years.80 Pomona also requires a basic human subjects course ("CPP Introduction to human subjects 101") for IRB submissions, valid for five years.81

Cal Poly SLO clearly has a mechanism for RCR training via the CITI program, strongly enforced by federal funding requirements like those from the NSF. However, the extent to which specific RCR training (beyond the NSF mandate) is universally required for *all* faculty and student researchers across all disciplines (e.g., within CAFES or CENG, regardless of funding source) is not fully specified in the provided documents. Furthermore, whether the current RCR training includes modules specifically tailored to address the unique ethical challenges arising from AI, machine learning, and large-scale data analysis in environmental research is also unclear. While the general RCR principles apply, specialized training concerning algorithmic bias, data privacy in large datasets, model transparency, and the responsible deployment of AI in environmental decision-making might be an area for future development within the university's RCR program.

## **IX. Synthesis, Analysis, and Strategic Recommendations**

This analysis provides a comprehensive assessment of Cal Poly San Luis Obispo's position at the intersection of natural resources, environmental science, agriculture, and advanced computational methods. The university leverages its distinctive "Learn by Doing" philosophy and polytechnic identity to create a unique educational and research environment. Key strengths, opportunities, and areas for potential development emerge from the data.

**Strengths:**

1. **Strong Foundational Programs:** CAFES, particularly the NRES department, offers well-regarded undergraduate programs in Forest and Fire Sciences, Environmental Management and Protection, and Environmental Earth and Soil Sciences, grounded in hands-on learning and incorporating foundational GIS and statistics.4 Programmatic accreditation (SAF for Forest/Fire Sciences) and endorsement (AEP for ENVM) attest to their quality.4  
2. **Applied Geospatial Expertise:** NRES faculty and the dedicated Geospatial Systems Lab demonstrate significant strength in applying GIS, remote sensing (LiDAR, UAVs), and geospatial data analysis to environmental challenges, particularly in fire science, hydrology, and ecosystem management.6  
3. **Emerging Data Science Capabilities:** The Cross Disciplinary Studies Minor in Data Science, alongside courses in statistical computing and learning within the Statistics department, provides pathways for students to gain data science skills.9 The Statistics department's consulting service facilitates broader application.30  
4. **Advanced Computational Expertise:** The CSSE department offers comprehensive curricula in AI, ML, databases, and HPC at both undergraduate and graduate levels, including a dedicated AI/ML concentration.8  
5. **Hubs for Interdisciplinary Innovation:** Centers like the WUI Fire Institute and the DxHub serve as effective catalysts for interdisciplinary research, external partnerships (industry, government), and applying advanced technologies (including AI) to real-world problems.45  
6. **Exceptional Field Research Assets:** Swanton Pacific Ranch provides an invaluable "living laboratory" with rich, long-term datasets (LiDAR, forest inventory, climate) ideal for data-intensive environmental research.49  
7. **Strategic Alignment:** University and college strategic plans emphasize leveraging data and technology, sustainability, and addressing societal challenges, providing a supportive context for integrating computational methods into environmental programs.64  
8. **Ethical Framework Development:** Active engagement with CSU system initiatives ensures a focus on the ethical and responsible use of AI in education and research.74 Standardized RCR training is in place via CITI.77

**Opportunities and Areas for Development:**

1. **Bridging the Computational Gap:** The most significant challenge identified is the accessibility of advanced computational courses (especially AI/ML in CSSE) for students in natural resource and environmental science majors due to extensive prerequisites.10 While the Data Science minor exists, its own prerequisites make it demanding for non-CS/Stats majors.9  
2. **Deepening AI/ML Integration in NRES:** While geospatial tools are well-integrated, the explicit application and teaching of advanced AI/ML techniques *within* NRES programs and research appear less pervasive, representing a major opportunity for growth.4  
3. **Clarifying HPC/GPU Resources:** The lack of clear, current public information on the specifications, accessibility, and support for central HPC and GPU resources at SLO creates uncertainty for researchers needing these capabilities.54  
4. **Formalizing Interdisciplinary Research Structures:** While centers like WUI and DxHub are successful, fostering more numerous and sustained faculty-level research collaborations and potentially establishing formal interdisciplinary research groups or centers specifically focused on "Computational Environmental Science" or "AI for Agriculture/Ecology" could amplify impact.  
5. **Explicit Computational Strategy in CAFES:** While CAFES's strategic goals imply the need for computational tools, explicitly articulating strategies involving AI, data science, and modeling to achieve "climate smart food production and environmental sustainability" could drive targeted investment and collaboration.68  
6. **Specialized AI Ethics Training:** Expanding RCR training to include modules specifically addressing the ethical considerations of AI and big data in environmental research and decision-making could be beneficial.

**Strategic Recommendations:**

Based on this analysis, the following recommendations are proposed to further enhance Cal Poly SLO's leadership at the intersection of natural sciences and advanced computation:

1. **Enhance Computational Pathways for Natural Science Students:**  
   * Develop and offer "Computational Methods for Environmental Scientists" or "Data Science for Natural Resources" courses with tailored prerequisites, focusing on applied programming (Python/R), data manipulation, visualization, and core ML/statistical learning concepts relevant to the domain.  
   * Explore creating formal "Computational Science" or "Geospatial Data Science" tracks/emphases within NRES majors, integrating necessary foundational CS/Stats courses early in the curriculum.  
   * Facilitate cross-listing or co-teaching of relevant advanced computational electives to improve accessibility.  
2. **Invest in and Clarify Research Computing Infrastructure:**  
   * Conduct and publish an assessment of the current state, usage, and needs for central HPC and GPU resources at SLO.  
   * Develop a clear roadmap for investment in and upgrading research computing infrastructure to support AI/ML and large-scale modeling needs.  
   * Establish transparent access policies, user support structures, and training programs for central HPC/GPU resources.  
3. **Foster Deeper Interdisciplinary Research Collaboration:**  
   * Incentivize joint research proposals and projects between faculty in NRES/CAFES and CSSE/Statistics/CENG through seed funding programs or workload recognition.  
   * Explore the creation of an interdisciplinary research center or initiative focused specifically on "AI and Data Science for Environmental Sustainability" to consolidate expertise, attract funding, and enhance visibility.  
   * Leverage the Statistics consulting service more strategically to build long-term research partnerships rather than just short-term consultations.  
4. **Integrate Explicit Computational Strategies into College Plans:**  
   * Encourage CAFES to explicitly incorporate AI, data science, and computational modeling as key strategies within its next strategic plan iteration for achieving goals related to climate-smart agriculture and environmental sustainability.  
5. **Strengthen Faculty Expertise and Training:**  
   * Support professional development for NRES faculty interested in incorporating more advanced computational methods into their teaching and research.  
   * Consider strategic hires in NRES with expertise specifically in environmental data science, AI/ML applications in ecology, or complex systems modeling.  
6. **Advance AI Ethics in Environmental Contexts:**  
   * Develop or adopt specific guidance and training modules (potentially within CITI) addressing the ethical considerations unique to applying AI/ML in natural resource management, conservation, and environmental justice contexts.

By addressing these areas, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo can build upon its existing strengths to become an even more prominent leader in preparing students and conducting research that leverages the power of computational science to address critical environmental and agricultural challenges.
