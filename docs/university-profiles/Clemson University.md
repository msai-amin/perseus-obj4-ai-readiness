Data Science graduates.29

The establishment of dedicated Data Science degree programs (B.S., online M.S., proposed M.S./Ph.D.) signifies a clear institutional commitment to this high-demand field.28 The structure of the B.S. program, allowing application areas from any discipline, inherently supports interdisciplinary work, such as applying data science methods to natural resource problems.28 Similarly, the online M.S. in Computer Science and the Master of Applied Computing provide pathways for students from diverse backgrounds (potentially including natural resources) to gain advanced computational skills, including AI/ML.22

## **4\. Curricular Integration: Bridging Disciplines**

The effective application of AI and computational methods to natural resource challenges hinges on curricula that bridge these domains. Analysis of Clemson's course offerings, minors, and certificates reveals both established pathways and areas for potential growth in integrating quantitative and computational skills within natural resource programs and vice-versa.

Foundational Quantitative Skills in Natural Resources:  
Core natural resource programs within CAFLS incorporate foundational quantitative and spatial analysis skills.

* **Statistics:** Introductory statistics courses like STAT 2300 (Statistical Methods I) are required or listed as options in ENR, FRM, WFB, and PES curricula.7 This provides a necessary baseline in statistical thinking.  
* **Geographic Information Systems (GIS):** GIS is a well-established tool in natural resource management. Courses like FOR 4340 / ENR 4340 / WFB 4340 (Geographic Information Systems for Natural Resources) are integral parts of the FRM and WFB programs and available within ENR.8 PES programs do not list this specific course in the available snippets, but related spatial analysis concepts may be covered in courses like FNR 2040 (Soil Information Systems).35 Other GIS courses exist, such as CRP 4300 (The Nature of GIS) and GEOG 3100 (GIS for Humanities and Social Sciences), indicating broader campus availability.42  
* **Modeling & Quantitative Methods:** Specific quantitative courses exist within majors, such as FOR 3020 (Forest Biometrics) 35, FOR 3080 (Remote Sensing in Forestry) 35, and WFB 4610 (Quantitative Ecology).36 Management-focused courses like FOR 4170 (Forest Resource Management and Regulation) and FOR 4250 (Forest Resource Management Plans) likely incorporate quantitative modeling.35

This integration ensures graduates possess fundamental data handling and spatial analysis skills crucial for the field. However, bridging to more advanced AI/ML techniques often requires coursework outside the primary department.

Advanced Computational Courses Relevant to Natural Resources:  
Clemson offers a range of advanced courses in AI, ML, data science, HPC, and related statistical methods, primarily through the School of Computing and the School of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences. Selected relevant courses include:

  * STAT 4110 / 6110 Regression Analysis and Experimental Design (or similar titles across snippets): Covers linear models, experimental design.63 Prereq: MATH 2060\.63  
  * STAT 4120 / 6120 Sampling Theory.30  
  * STAT 4170 / 6170 Multivariate Statistics.67  
  * STAT 8050 Design and Analysis of Experiments.70  
* **High-Performance Computing (HPC):**  
  * CPSC 4780 / 6780 (cross-listed ECE) General-Purpose Computation on GPUs: Covers CUDA and OpenCL programming for GPUs.72 Prereqs: C programming, linear algebra, data structures, Linux.72

Accessing these advanced courses often requires significant prerequisites in computer science (data structures like CPSC 2120\) and mathematics/statistics (calculus, linear algebra, probability).24 This prerequisite structure presents a potential barrier for natural resource students seeking to integrate advanced computational methods without careful planning or pursuing dual majors/minors.

Minors and Certificates:  
Formal programs exist to facilitate cross-disciplinary skill development:

* **Minors:**  
  * *AI Minor:* Requires 24 credits, including programming and statistical foundations, with coursework in AI, data science, and ML.73  
  * *Computer Science Minor:* Requires CPSC 2120 and 12 additional CPSC credits (\>=9 at 3000+ level).74  
  * *Statistics Minor (Undergraduate):* Part of the Mathematical Sciences Minor, requiring MATH 2080 and 12 additional MATH/STAT credits (3000+ level, excluding specific courses).76 A distinct Statistics minor is not explicitly listed in the 2024-25 catalog snippets provided, but Math/Stat courses form a core part of the Data Science major and AI minor.28 Graduate minors in Mathematical Sciences and Statistics exist.78  
  * *Data Science Minor:* Not explicitly listed as a standalone minor in the provided snippets, though Data Science is a major 28 and a popular minor choice *for* Data Science majors is Computer Science or Mathematical Sciences.28 The AI minor covers data science topics.73 The lack of a dedicated Data Science minor might be a gap, although the B.S. program and AI minor provide pathways.  
  * Natural resource students can pursue minors like Wildlife and Fisheries Biology or Plant and Environmental Sciences.5  
* **Certificates:**  
  * *GIS Certificate (Non-credit):* The Clemson Center for Geospatial Technologies (CCGT) offers a non-credit "Certificate of Attendance" for completing a series of 6 hands-on workshops (18 hours total) covering ArcGIS Pro, data management, spatial analysis, and spatial statistics.82 This provides practical, accessible GIS training across disciplines.83 It is not a formal academic certificate reflected on transcripts.  
  * *Formal Academic Certificates (Graduate):* Clemson offers graduate certificates, but the snippets do not confirm currently active, formally transcripted graduate certificates specifically titled "GIS," "Data Science," or "Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning" accessible broadly across disciplines.  
    * A *System Analytics Certificate* (online, 12 credits) exists within Civil Engineering (CE 8450, 8470, 8480, 8490\) focusing on data mining, optimization, and risk analytics.61  
    * A *Business Analytics Certificate* (12 credits) is offered through the MBA program (MBA 8020, 8080, 8140, 8990).86  
    * An online *Machine Learning with Python* certificate course is offered via Ed2Go, seemingly as professional development rather than academic credit.89  
    * While AIRISE facilitates AI education 26 and the MAC program has AI/ML and Data Science tracks 22, dedicated, broadly accessible graduate certificates in these core areas were not identified in the provided 2024-2025 catalog information.22

The availability of the AI minor represents a significant step towards integrating these skills across undergraduate programs. The non-credit CCGT workshops provide valuable practical GIS training accessible to all. However, the pathway for natural resource graduate students to gain formal, transcripted credentials in advanced AI/ML or Data Science appears less defined compared to the undergraduate AI minor, potentially requiring enrollment in full degree programs like the MAC or M.S. in CS/Data Science, or relying on specific coursework selection within their primary degree.

* **Industry Partnerships:** AIRISE actively engages industry.26 A symposium on AI featured participation from major companies like Siemens, IBM, Boeing, and Michelin.114 Collaborations exist around specific technologies, such as the use of Metamoto software on Palmetto for the OpenCAV project 99 and LexisNexis support for big data research using HPCC Systems.112 The development of the Big Data Smart Socket (BDSS) software targeted optimizing large data transfers, particularly relevant for genomics but applicable broadly.115

The combination of powerful, AI-ready HPC infrastructure (Palmetto 2 with H100s and Indigo storage), dedicated interdisciplinary centers (AIRISE, Watt AI, CCGT, BICEFS), and faculty expertise across computational and natural resource domains positions Clemson well for impactful research. Initiatives like AIRISE and the Watt AI program are crucial for fostering the necessary collaboration between computational experts and domain scientists. The significant investment in H100 GPUs and high-performance storage specifically addresses the needs of large-scale data analysis and complex modeling inherent in modern natural resource AI research, moving beyond traditional GIS and statistical methods.

## **6\. Responsible Innovation: Ethics and Training**

As Clemson integrates AI and advanced computation into research and education, it maintains policies and training programs focused on responsible use and ethical conduct.

AI Usage Guidelines and Academic Integrity:  
Recognizing the potential risks associated with generative AI and other tools, Clemson has established specific guidelines through CCIT and academic bodies.116

* **Data Privacy:** A primary concern is the protection of institutional data. Users are explicitly warned not to input internal use, confidential, or restricted data (e.g., student records, proprietary research, PHI, FERPA-protected information) into publicly available AI tools, as this data may be retained and used for model training.116 Use is generally restricted to public data unless utilizing an approved, secure system (e.g., Clemson's Zoom AI Companion is approved for certain sensitive data types, but third-party apps are not).116 Opting out of data sharing for AI learning is recommended where possible.116  
* **Accuracy and Verification:** The guidelines acknowledge that AI tools can produce inaccurate information ("hallucinations") and stress the importance of verifying AI-generated outputs against authoritative sources.116  
* **Transparency and Citation:** Users are expected to be transparent about their use of AI tools and cite them appropriately.116 The Clemson Writing Lab and Libraries offer resources on AI in academic writing and proper citation.117  
* **Academic Integrity:** University policies explicitly forbid plagiarism, including the submission of AI-generated work as one's own.116

This proactive development of AI-specific guidelines demonstrates an institutional awareness of the unique challenges posed by these technologies, aiming to foster responsible adoption rather than outright prohibition.

Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) Training:  
Clemson mandates RCR training for faculty, staff, students, and trainees involved in research, particularly those supported by federal grants (e.g., NSF, USDA NIFA).119 This training provides a foundational framework for ethical research practices relevant to computational and data-intensive work.

* **Structure:** The requirement involves two phases 119:  
  1. **Basic Training:** Completed online via the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI). Users select a discipline-specific RCR course (e.g., Physical Science, Social & Behavioral Research, etc.).119 CITI registration is managed individually, affiliating with Clemson University.119  
  2. **Advanced Training:** Consists of discussion-based contact hours (5 for undergraduates, 8 for graduate students and postdocs).119 This phase covers both general and discipline-specific ethical issues and can be fulfilled through workshops, seminars, courses, or other activities approved by the Principal Investigator (PI).119 The Office of Research Compliance (ORC) offers a regular "Brown Bag" series that counts towards this requirement, and other campus offerings are also tracked.119  
* **Content:** RCR training covers core topics including data acquisition, analysis, management, sharing, and ownership; authorship and plagiarism; peer review; conflict of interest; research misconduct; mentor/mentee responsibilities; lab safety; and the societal impacts of research.122 The topic "Secure and ethical use of data" is explicitly included.122  
* **Human Subjects:** Separate CITI training is required for research involving human subjects, overseen by the Institutional Review Board (IRB).121

The existing RCR framework addresses many ethical considerations pertinent to AI and computational research, such as data integrity, management, and authorship. While the snippets reviewed do not detail specific RCR modules exclusively focused on AI ethics (like algorithmic bias or model transparency), the requirement for discipline-specific training and discussion-based advanced training provides avenues to address these emerging issues within relevant contexts.119 The fundamental principles taught through RCR are essential for ensuring rigor and integrity in computationally driven natural resource science.

## **7\. Conclusion and Recommendations**

Clemson University demonstrates significant strengths in both natural resource sciences and the rapidly evolving fields of AI and computational science. Established programs in CAFLS provide deep domain expertise in forestry, wildlife biology, environmental science, and plant sciences, supported by accredited curricula and extensive research infrastructure like the Experimental Forest and the Baruch Institute.4 Concurrently, CECAS and the College of Science offer robust programs in computer science, data science, and mathematical/statistical sciences, complemented by the powerful Palmetto HPC cluster and dedicated research initiatives like AIRISE and the Watt AI Program.20

The integration of AI and computational methods into natural resource research and education is actively underway. Foundational skills like statistics and GIS are embedded in core natural resource curricula.35 Advanced capabilities are accessible through cross-disciplinary coursework, minors (notably the AI minor 73), and collaborative research projects often facilitated by centers like AIRISE or leveraging the Palmetto cluster's advanced GPU resources.26 The university's strategic plan, Clemson Elevate, explicitly targets AI and data science as focus areas, aligning institutional goals with the investments observed in infrastructure (Palmetto 2 upgrades) and new academic programs (B.S. in Data Science, proposed graduate programs in Statistics & Data Science).29 Applying these advanced computational tools to natural resource challenges directly supports Clemson's land-grant mission by addressing critical state and global environmental issues.1

However, bridging the gap between disciplines remains key. Students seeking deep integration require careful academic planning due to prerequisite chains for advanced computational courses and the current structure of minors and certificates, particularly at the graduate level where formal certificate options in AI/Data Science seem less developed than the undergraduate AI minor.22 Continued development of interdisciplinary hubs and potentially more flexible curricular pathways will be crucial for maximizing Clemson's potential in this area.
