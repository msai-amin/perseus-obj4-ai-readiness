## **3\. Academic Foundation: Natural Resources Programs at CSU**

Colorado State University provides a strong academic foundation in natural resource disciplines, primarily centered within the Warner College of Natural Resources (WCNR).

### **3.1. Warner College of Natural Resources (WCNR) Overview**

WCNR stands as one of the largest and most comprehensive natural resource colleges in the United States, boasting a history of over a century dedicated to research, education, and outreach concerning environmental and natural resource issues.1 The college is recognized for its innovative programming and commitment to addressing critical challenges both regionally and globally.1 It fosters a strong sense of community among its approximately 2,400 students, faculty, and staff.1 WCNR's structure encompasses five academic departments that span the physical, biological, and social sciences pertinent to natural resources, enabling a broad, interdisciplinary approach to complex environmental problems.1

### **3.2. WCNR Departments and Program Areas**

The five core departments within WCNR offer a diverse array of undergraduate and graduate programs:

* **Ecosystem Science and Sustainability (ESS):** This department focuses on integrating ecosystem science into the sustainable management of natural resources, addressing global challenges related to water, climate change, land use, and food systems.3 It maintains a close affiliation with the Natural Resource Ecology Laboratory (NREL), offering students research opportunities.3 Degree offerings include Bachelor of Science (B.S.), Master of Science (M.S.), Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.), and a Professional Science Master's (PSM).2  
* **Fish, Wildlife, and Conservation Biology (FWCB):** As the only comprehensive program of its kind in Colorado, FWCB provides undergraduate and graduate education focused on the conservation and management of fish and wildlife populations and their habitats.6 It offers a B.S. degree with concentrations in Conservation Biology, Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences, and Wildlife Biology, alongside M.S., Master of Fish, Wildlife, and Conservation Biology (M.F.W.C.B.), and Ph.D. programs.2 The department has a reputation for developing quantitative methods applicable to applied ecology and conservation biology.7  
* **Forest and Rangeland Stewardship (FRS):** This department prepares students for the stewardship of forest and rangeland ecosystems, emphasizing sustainable management practices informed by STEM fields.8 It offers a B.S. degree with multiple concentrations (Forest Biology, Forest Fire Science, Forest Management, Rangeland and Forest Management, Rangeland Conservation and Management), M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Forest Sciences and Rangeland Ecosystem Science, and a Master of Natural Resources Stewardship (MNRS) degree.2 Field experience, particularly at CSU's Mountain Campus, is a key component.8  
* **Geosciences:** Offering B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees, the Geosciences department focuses on geology, environmental geology, geophysics, and hydrogeology.2 The curriculum emphasizes field studies integrated with classroom and laboratory work, with opportunities for students to take complementary courses in Engineering and Watershed Sciences.13  
* **Human Dimensions of Natural Resources (HDNR):** This department addresses the social, cultural, political, economic, and ethical aspects of natural resource management and conservation.15 It offers B.S. degrees in HDNR and Natural Resource Tourism (NRT), including an online NRT option, as well as graduate programs leading to M.S. (HDNR, Conservation Leadership, Tourism Management \- MTM) and Ph.D. degrees.2 An interdisciplinary approach bridging social and biophysical sciences is central to its mission.15

### **3.3. Accreditation Status**

The quality and professional relevance of academic programs are often validated through accreditation by external bodies.

* **Society of American Foresters (SAF):** The B.S. in Forest and Rangeland Stewardship program, specifically the concentrations in Forest Biology, Forest Fire Science, and Forest Management, is accredited by SAF.8 This accreditation ensures the program meets rigorous standards established by the forestry profession, preparing graduates for careers in the field.10 CSU's SAF Alpha chapter was the first student group of its kind in the nation.11  
* **The Wildlife Society (TWS):** While TWS offers certification for individual wildlife biologists based on education and experience standards 19, and lists CSU among universities offering relevant online course categories 20, evidence confirming *programmatic accreditation* of CSU's Fish, Wildlife, and Conservation Biology degrees by TWS was not found in the reviewed materials.6 TWS accreditation is a distinct process from individual certification.18 The presence of a TWS student chapter at CSU indicates engagement with the professional society, but does not equate to program accreditation.21  
* **Higher Learning Commission (HLC):** As an institution, Colorado State University is accredited by the HLC, which provides assurance that all academic degrees and course credits meet established quality standards and are recognized for federal financial aid, employment, and further education purposes.23

The robust and diverse programs within WCNR provide a strong foundation in various natural resource disciplines. The clear SAF accreditation for the Forest and Rangeland Stewardship program provides external validation of its alignment with professional standards. However, the lack of explicit confirmation regarding TWS programmatic accreditation for the Fish, Wildlife, and Conservation Biology program presents an information gap. This suggests that FWCB graduates may primarily rely on meeting TWS standards for individual certification rather than benefiting from program-level accreditation, a different approach compared to the FRS program's SAF accreditation.

## **4\. Curriculum Analysis: Bridging Natural Resources with Computational & Data Science**

An analysis of the curricula within WCNR reveals varying levels of integration for computational and data science skills, with particular strength in geospatial technologies.

### **4.1. Geospatial Technologies (GIS & Remote Sensing)**

### **4.3. Data Science, AI/ML Integration (within WCNR)**

While foundational quantitative and geospatial skills are integrated, the explicit incorporation of advanced data science, AI, and ML into WCNR's *own* course offerings appears less developed, particularly at the undergraduate level.

* **Graduate Level Examples:** ESS offers ESS 523D (Environmental Data Science Applications: Reproducible Remote Sensing Models) 24 and its PSM programs emphasize coding and modeling skills.5  
* **Faculty-Driven Integration:** Some faculty within WCNR, like Professor Yu Wei (FRS), actively use and teach machine learning techniques in the context of forest management and fire decision support.33 Postdoctoral researchers, such as Richard Berl in HDNR, also apply computational and ML methods.35  
* **Cross-Departmental Reliance:** For specialized training in AI/ML algorithms, deep learning, or advanced data science programming, students within WCNR likely need to pursue coursework offered by other departments, such as Computer Science or Statistics (detailed in Section 5).

### **4.4. Relevant Certificates & Minors**

Several minors and certificates provide pathways for students to augment their natural resource degrees with computational or data analysis skills:

* **Minor in Geospatial Information Science in Natural Resources (WCNR):** Offers focused training in GIS/RS within a natural resources context.25

* **Graduate Certificate in Theory and Applications of Regression Models (Statistics Dept.):** Another statistics-focused certificate available online or on-campus.38  
* **Graduate Certificate in Conservation Actions with Lands, Animals, and People (FWCB):** An online certificate focused on conservation problem-solving, implementation, and evaluation.22 Less focused on computational techniques compared to the Data Analysis certificate.  
* **Other WCNR Certificates:** Certificates like Advanced Silviculture or Climate Adaptation and Risk Management (CARMA) exist but appear less directly focused on core computational or data science skills.8

The curriculum analysis highlights a clear strength and established integration of GIS and remote sensing across WCNR, supported by numerous courses and a dedicated minor. This provides students with essential tools for spatial data handling and analysis relevant to natural resources. However, the integration of cutting-edge AI, ML, and advanced data science techniques *within* WCNR's specific course offerings is currently less explicit, especially at the undergraduate level. While foundational quantitative skills and modeling are present, students seeking deep expertise in AI/ML methodologies typically must supplement their WCNR studies with courses from other departments. The Graduate Certificate in Data Analysis from the Statistics Department serves as a key structured pathway for WCNR graduate students and professionals to gain certified data analysis skills, formally connecting statistical training with natural resource applications through its elective options.

* **CS AI/ML Courses:** The sequence for CS 345, CS 440, and CS 445 typically requires foundational CS (Data Structures, Algorithms), advanced Math (Calculus II, Linear Algebra), and Statistics.42 This pathway demands significant coursework beyond typical natural resource degree requirements, potentially necessitating a minor, dual major, or substantial elective planning starting early in an undergraduate career.  
* **Data Science Courses:** DSCI 445 (Statistical ML) requires Linear Algebra (DSCI/MATH 369\) and STAT 341 (Statistical Data Analysis I).50 Other DSCI courses also build upon CS, Math, and Stats foundations.50 Accessibility hinges on a student's quantitative preparation.  
* **Advanced Statistics Courses:** Courses like STAT 400 (Statistical Computing), STAT 440 (Bayesian), and STAT 460 (Multivariate) require prerequisites such as introductory CS, Probability/Mathematical Statistics (STAT 420), Statistical Data Analysis I (STAT 341), and Linear Algebra.47 These demand a stronger theoretical statistics background than might be gained from introductory applied statistics courses common in WCNR.

This concentration of specialized AI, ML, Data Science, and HPC training within specific departments (Computer Science, Statistics, Engineering), coupled with demanding prerequisite sequences involving core computer science, advanced mathematics, and theoretical statistics, presents potential accessibility challenges for students whose primary academic focus lies within traditional Natural Resources programs. Bridging this disciplinary gap effectively may require proactive academic advising, potential modifications to WCNR pathways to incorporate more rigorous quantitative preparation, or the development of dedicated interdisciplinary programs, minors, or certificates specifically designed to integrate these skill sets.

Despite these challenges, students possess multiple avenues for acquiring valuable computational and data analysis skills beyond the intensive CS AI/ML concentration. The interdisciplinary Data Science major, applied courses and certificates offered by the Statistics department, and increasingly relevant coursework within the College of Engineering provide alternative pathways. This flexibility allows students to select options that align with their specific interests, quantitative aptitude, and career aspirations, enabling them to gain crucial data-driven skills applicable to natural resource fields, even if the full theoretical depth of a specialized CS degree is not pursued.

## **7\. Research Infrastructure: High-Performance Computing & Software**

CSU provides its researchers with access to significant computational resources necessary for data-intensive and computationally demanding research, including AI and ML applications in natural resources.

### **7.1. Primary HPC Resource: Alpine**

The primary HPC resource for CSU researchers is the Alpine supercomputer.94 Alpine is the successor to the previous Summit system and is operated as a joint activity between CSU and the University of Colorado Boulder (CU Boulder), managed under the umbrella of the Rocky Mountain Advanced Computing Consortium (RMACC).94 The original Summit system was established with support from a National Science Foundation Major Research Instrumentation (NSF MRI) grant.94 Alpine is housed at and operated by CU IT staff, but is available campus-wide to CSU faculty, graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, advanced undergraduates, and affiliated organizations.94

While specific, up-to-date specifications for Alpine were not detailed in the provided materials, the architecture of its predecessor, Summit, was heterogeneous. It included thousands of Intel Haswell CPU cores, tens of thousands of Nvidia K80 GPU cores (essential for deep learning), Intel Knights-Landing Phi cores (on a smaller partition), and high-memory compute nodes (up to 2 TB RAM each).96 The system utilized a high-speed OmniPath interconnect and an IBM GPFS parallel file system.96 It is reasonable to expect Alpine to possess similar or enhanced capabilities suitable for large-scale, data- and compute-intensive applications.96

### **7.2. Software Environment**

The software environment on the CSU/CU Boulder HPC resources is designed to support a wide range of scientific computing needs.

* **Operating System & Programming:** Summit ran Red Hat Enterprise Linux.96 Supported languages included C, C++, Fortran, CUDA (for GPU programming), Perl, Python, and shell scripting.96 Parallel programming is supported via MPI and OpenMP.96 Alpine explicitly supports Python and R through the Anaconda distribution, simplifying package management for scientific computing.97  
* **Compilers & Libraries:** Standard compilers like Intel, GNU, and CUDA were available on Summit.96 AMD Optimizing Compilers (AOCC) are available on Alpine.98 A rich suite of parallel libraries, performance analysis tools, and debugging utilities are generally available.96  
* **AI/ML Software Stacks:** Specific AI/ML libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch are *not explicitly listed* as centrally installed software modules in the provided documentation for Summit or Alpine.94 However, the robust support for Python via Anaconda 97 and the availability of GPUs 96 create an environment where researchers can readily install and manage these standard frameworks within their own user environments or containers (e.g., Conda environments). This is common practice on many HPC clusters. Users needing specific AI/ML tools should consult the Research Computing support team or documentation for installation guidance.  
* **Other Software:** Various scientific and engineering software packages are available, such as Ansys (CAE/simulation), ANTLR (parser generator), and numerical libraries like AOCL.98

### **7.3. Access and Allocation**

Access to Alpine is provided to CSU affiliates, with allocations managed based on computational needs.

* **Eligibility:** CSU faculty, graduate students, postdocs, and advanced undergraduates can gain access.96  
* **Allocation:** CSU holds approximately 22.5% of the total allocation on the base system.94 New users are typically added to a general CSU allocation pool (csu-general) providing around 50,000 Service Units (SU, equivalent to CPU core-hours) per year.94 Researchers requiring more substantial resources can apply for larger, project-specific allocations by contacting Research Computing support ([rc2-request@colostate.edu](mailto:rc2-request@colostate.edu)).94 Applications are reviewed by the Summit Management and Allocations Review Committee.94  
* **Condo Model:** Researchers or groups can also purchase their own compute nodes ("condo" model) to be integrated into the cluster, guaranteeing access to those specific resources.94

### **7.4. Support and Data Management**

Support services and data management tools are available to assist researchers.

* **User Support:** End-user consultation, programming assistance, and application support are provided by CSU Graduate Research Assistants (GRAs) and dedicated CU staff assigned to CSU users. All help requests are channeled through [rc-help@colorado.edu](mailto:rc-help@colorado.edu).94  
* **Research Computing & Cyberinfrastructure (RCC):** This CSU group offers consulting on cyberinfrastructure needs, data transport (via Globus), data storage (RStor network-attached storage), and data preservation.99 Globus facilitates large, automated, and reliable data transfers between systems.100  
* **Network:** CSU maintains a high-speed network infrastructure, including a Research DMZ LAN, to support researcher collaboration and data exchange.100

### **7.5. Other Computational Resources**

Beyond Alpine, CSU researchers may leverage other resources:

* **NRP Nautilus:** CSU faculty and students have access to the National Research Platform's Nautilus, a distributed network of interconnected computers hosted at universities nationwide, suitable for research and training.101  
* **TIDE Cluster:** The Technology Infrastructure for Data Exploration (TIDE) cluster at San Diego State University, funded by NSF, focuses on ML and AI research needs and is accessible to researchers within the CSU system.102  
* **DSRI Riviera:** The Data Science Research Institute mentions a new campus HPC system named Riviera, intended to expand research capabilities.103 Its exact specifications and relationship to Alpine require further clarification.

The provision of HPC resources through a collaborative model like RMACC allows CSU researchers access to a larger, more powerful system (Alpine) than might be feasible for a single institution to procure and manage alone. This shared infrastructure provides significant scale for computationally intensive research. However, it also means navigating support structures and potentially policies managed jointly with CU Boulder. The availability of multiple platforms (Alpine, Nautilus, TIDE, Riviera) offers flexibility but necessitates that researchers identify the resource best suited to their specific computational requirements and data needs.

While specific AI/ML libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch are not listed as pre-installed system modules, the infrastructure strongly supports their use. The availability of the Anaconda environment for Python and R management, coupled with GPU resources and dedicated user support, creates an enabling environment where researchers can effectively set up and utilize these standard AI/ML frameworks to tackle complex problems in natural resources and other fields.

The university utilizes established platforms like CITI for standardized online training and mandates specific training, including face-to-face components, for researchers involved in human subjects work or those supported by key federal funding agencies (NSF, NIH, USDA NIFA). This systematic approach ensures that students and researchers are aware of ethical expectations and compliance requirements related to both general research practices and emerging technologies like AI.

## **11\. Synthesis and Conclusion**

Colorado State University possesses significant and synergistic strengths positioning it as a capable institution for research and education at the confluence of natural resource sciences and artificial intelligence/computational science. The Warner College of Natural Resources provides a deep and broad foundation in ecological, environmental, forestry, wildlife, geospatial, and human dimensions disciplines, complemented by strong programs in Computer Science, Statistics, Data Science, and Engineering that offer specialized training in AI, ML, HPC, and advanced quantitative methods.

Key synergistic elements include the Natural Resource Ecology Laboratory (NREL), which serves as a vital bridge integrating advanced computational techniques (modeling, remote sensing, data analysis) directly into ecosystem science research, often involving faculty with joint appointments in WCNR. The Data Science Research Institute (DSRI) acts as a campus-wide catalyst, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, supporting data-intensive research, and promoting AI/HPC literacy. Access to robust HPC resources via the Alpine supercomputer (through the RMACC partnership) provides the necessary computational infrastructure, while established ethical frameworks for AI and RCR ensure responsible innovation. The university also benefits from a considerable number of faculty across multiple colleges whose expertise explicitly spans computational methods and natural resource applications, alongside successful partnerships with federal agencies (USDA, NASA, NSF) and industry that provide funding and real-world context.

Despite these strengths, opportunities for further development exist. The most prominent is the need for enhanced curricular integration and accessibility. While WCNR excels in geospatial training, pathways for natural resource students to gain deep expertise in AI/ML require navigating complex prerequisite chains in Computer Science and Statistics. Developing more explicit AI/ML coursework within WCNR, creating dedicated interdisciplinary certificates or minors, or establishing clearer advising pathways could significantly lower barriers and foster a new generation of computationally fluent natural resource professionals. Clarifying the TWS programmatic accreditation status for FWCB would also provide greater transparency. Additionally, increasing the public visibility of specific AI/ML software stacks supported on Alpine would aid researchers in planning their computational work. Finally, continued strategic coordination at the university level is essential to ensure that the aligned priorities of individual colleges translate into cohesive, well-supported interdisciplinary initiatives that fully leverage CSU's potential in applying AI to pressing natural resource and environmental challenges.

In conclusion, CSU has assembled many of the critical components—domain expertise in natural resources, growing strength in AI/data science, key interdisciplinary researchers and centers, necessary computational infrastructure, and strategic institutional support—to be a significant contributor to the advancement and application of AI in understanding and managing natural systems. By focusing on strengthening the bridges between disciplines, particularly in academic training, CSU can further solidify its position as a leader in this vital and rapidly evolving field.
