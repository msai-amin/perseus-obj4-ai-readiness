## **V. Computational Infrastructure: Powering Advanced Research**

The application of AI and advanced computational methods to natural resource challenges necessitates robust and accessible high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure, including Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and a comprehensive software stack. Duke University provides such capabilities primarily through its central research computing facilities.

### **A. Duke's Central Research Computing Facilities (Duke Compute Cluster \- DCC)**

The **Duke Compute Cluster (DCC)** serves as the university's general-purpose HPC and high-throughput computing resource, designed to support a wide array of scientific projects across disciplines.65 It is the primary centralized platform for computationally intensive research at Duke, including the AI, machine learning, and large-scale data analysis tasks increasingly common in natural resource science.

**High-Performance Computing (HPC) and GPU Capabilities**

The DCC offers significant computational power. For instance, the Bioinformatics Shared Resource reports that the DCC comprises over 45,000 vCPU-cores and 980 GPUs, with underlying hardware from Cisco Systems UCS blades and GPU-accelerated computers from Silicon Mechanics featuring a range of Nvidia GPUs.67 Specific GPU resources mentioned include NVIDIA Tesla P100s, with some nodes equipped with 44 Intel Xeon CPU E5-2699 v4 cores and 2 P100 GPUs each.68 For course support, dedicated resources include 10 servers each with 2 P100 (16GB RAM) GPUs, totaling 20 GPUs for educational purposes.69 Additionally, entities like the Center for Health and Society Institute (CHSI) have priority access to specific DCC nodes, including some configured with RTX 2080 Ti GPUs.70 The availability of a substantial and varied pool of GPUs is critical for deep learning, complex simulations, and the processing of large datasets, such as those derived from remote sensing, which are integral to modern natural resource AI applications.

**Supported AI/ML Software Environments**

The DCC supports a range of software environments conducive to AI/ML research. Interactive tools like MATLAB, RStudio, and Jupyter Notebooks are readily available.66 Python and R, the dominant languages for data science and machine learning, are explicitly supported.66 The system primarily relies on Free and Open Source Software, and users or departments can request the installation of additional software, provided it is open source and suitable for a cluster environment.65

Specifically for AI/ML, TensorFlow can be run within Jupyter Notebooks on the DCC through the use of Singularity containers (e.g., using docker://jupyter/tensorflow-notebook).70 The general support for open-source software and containerization suggests that other common AI/ML libraries such as PyTorch and scikit-learn are likely usable, either pre-installed as modules or installable by users or administrators. The R statistical environment, along with its vast collection of packages from CRAN and Bioconductor, is actively maintained.67 Commercial software packages including SAS, Matlab, Maple, and Mathematica are also available via Duke's site-license agreements.67 For reproducible research, tools like RMarkdown and Jupyter Notebooks are utilized, and version control is managed via Duke's internal GitLab repository.67

However, specific high-end commercial GIS software, such as ArcGIS Pro or QGIS, are not explicitly listed as centrally available modules on the DCC in the provided documentation.71 While open-source GIS capabilities and geospatial libraries within Python and R are almost certainly usable on the DCC, researchers heavily reliant on commercial GIS packages for pre-processing or complex spatial analysis might need to utilize departmental licenses or individual installations. This suggests that while the DCC provides a strong *computational backend* for AI/ML tasks involving geospatial data, the *interactive GIS software ecosystem* on the cluster itself may lean more towards open-source tools or user-managed solutions.

**Access Policies and Support for Researchers and Students**

Duke aims to provide broad access to the DCC. Computing and storage allocations are typically provided at no cost for most researchers in faculty labs and for all PhD students.66 PhD students can claim their allocation through Research Toolkits.66 Specific support for courses is also available, with dedicated resources allocated for 500-level or higher courses, particularly those focusing on ML/AI.69

The access model is tiered: general users can access common university-purchased nodes and have low-priority access to researcher-purchased nodes. Researchers or groups who invest in their own nodes (buy-in model) receive high-priority access to their equipment, in addition to general access privileges.65 This system is designed to maximize cluster efficiency while allowing groups with intensive computational needs to secure dedicated resources.65

Regarding data security, the DCC is designed for public or restricted data according to Duke's data classification standards. The use of sensitive data, such as Protected Health Information (PHI) or data covered by FERPA, is generally not permitted on the DCC unless it has been appropriately de-identified or obfuscated.65 This is an important consideration for natural resource researchers who might handle data with privacy implications (e.g., precise locations of endangered species on private lands, or environmental justice data linked to individuals).

It is worth noting that the Duke School of Medicine operates its own Research Computing Center (SRCC), which offers both on-premises HPC (with CPU and GPU nodes, including NVidia L40S) and cloud-based (Azure) HPC solutions.67 The SRCC is specifically designed to handle sensitive data types, including PHI. While primarily serving biomedical research, the existence of this robust infrastructure and its operational model for sensitive data might offer valuable insights or collaborative opportunities for NSOE or other environmental researchers if their work involves highly sensitive datasets requiring such a secure environment.

The DCC's operational model, with its tiered access, no-cost allocations for many researchers and students, and course support, effectively balances broad accessibility with the need for dedicated resources for computationally intensive projects. This approach helps lower the barrier to entry for HPC use and supports a wide range of research and educational activities relevant to natural resources AI.

The following table summarizes the key aspects of the Duke Compute Cluster relevant to AI/ML research in natural resources.

**Table 5: Overview of Duke Compute Cluster (DCC) for AI/ML Research**

A landmark $30 million award from The Duke Endowment is dedicated to elevating research in computing, AI, and machine learning through a significant faculty hiring initiative over five years.64 This funding, part of the broader Duke Science and Technology initiative, aims to attract top-tier talent and accelerate innovation, with initial hires planned for the Departments of Computer Science and Electrical and Computer Engineering.64 Such investment is intended to enhance Duke's profile, create new research and educational opportunities, increase grant funding, and foster corporate partnerships.64

Complementing this financial investment is Duke's AI Framework, which establishes four pillars for AI development—Learn, Research, Teach, and Work—built upon a strong foundational AI infrastructure and systems.75 This framework emphasizes interdisciplinary collaboration, ethical responsibility, and cutting-edge research, signaling a holistic and principled approach to AI integration across the university.75 Furthermore, Duke's "Computational Thinking" initiative aims to ensure that every student, regardless of their field of study, is prepared for the digital demands of the 21st century, fostering a computationally fluent student body essential for applying AI in diverse domains.60

**Nicholas School of the Environment (NSOE)**

The Nicholas School of the Environment's 2017-2022 Strategic Plan, while predating the most recent surge in AI, articulated a value for "a deliberate mix of applied problem-solving and fundamental research in the physical, life, and social sciences".76 Key goals within this plan included developing a certificate in environmental data analysis and investing in data processing infrastructure.76 These objectives laid the groundwork for NSOE's current trajectory. The subsequent development of the MEM concentration in Environmental Analytics and Modeling (EAM) 17 and the Geospatial Analysis Certificate Program 27 are direct manifestations of this strategic direction toward more quantitative and data-intensive environmental science.

More recently, NSOE's strategic direction is evidenced by the hiring of faculty with explicit expertise in AI, machine learning, and remote sensing for environmental applications, such as Professor Liyin He.51 The school also fosters a "burgeoning ethos of innovation" that embraces interdisciplinary collaboration, exemplified by projects like GridSeer, an AI-driven energy platform co-developed by NSOE and Pratt faculty.47 These actions demonstrate NSOE's active adaptation to leverage advanced computational tools for addressing environmental problems.

**Pratt School of Engineering**

The Pratt School of Engineering has a clear strategic focus on applied AI. Its Master of Engineering in AI for Product Innovation (AIPI) is recognized as a top applied AI/ML graduate program, developed in collaboration with industry to train leaders in designing and building AI-powered software products.32 Pratt also boasts significant research strengths in "Data Science, Advanced Computing & Intelligent Systems," supported by major centers and initiatives in AI & Machine Learning, Quantum Computing, Computer Systems, and Computational Design.77 This indicates a deep and multifaceted strategic commitment within the engineering school to advancing computational research and AI.

**Trinity College of Arts & Sciences**

Trinity College of Arts & Sciences' strategic vision includes a commitment to investing in the sciences, acknowledging the significant resources required for laboratories, space, and specialized instrumentation.78 While not singling out AI or data science as the exclusive focus, strengthening the sciences—which encompass the vital Departments of Computer Science and Statistical Science—is fundamental to supporting advanced computational research across the university. Trinity College has also been proactive in addressing the societal impacts of AI, issuing guidelines on the ethical and responsible use of generative AI tools to uphold academic integrity and protect data privacy.79

### **B. Alignment with Natural Resource and Environmental Grand Challenges**

Duke's strategic focus on AI and computational methods is increasingly aligned with addressing pressing natural resource and environmental grand challenges. NSOE faculty research employing AI and machine learning directly tackles issues such as climate change impacts (Professors He, Qiu, Borsuk), sustainable energy systems (Professor Patiño-Echeverri), biodiversity conservation (Professors Qiu, Halpin), and sustainable agricultural management (Professor He).41

Initiatives like the Climate+ program, a collaboration between the Rhodes Information Initiative at Duke and the Nicholas Institute, explicitly link data science and AI training to the interdisciplinary understanding of climate change's causes, societal impacts, and the development of sustainable solutions.49 This program directly engages students in applying computational methods to one of the most significant global environmental challenges.

Furthermore, Duke University's institutional commitment to achieving carbon neutrality and its investments in renewable energy 80 create a conducive environment and potential real-world testbeds for research in sustainable energy systems, such as the AI-driven GridSeer platform.

The university-wide advancements in AI, fueled by strategic investments and faculty hiring, act as a catalyst for specialized applications within natural resource domains. While these broad initiatives may not be primarily targeted at environmental science, the enhanced AI research environment, the influx of talent in AI methodologies, and improvements in computational infrastructure inevitably benefit NSOE and environmentally-focused engineering research. Concurrently, the strategic hiring of faculty with explicit AI/ML and remote sensing expertise within NSOE, coupled with the development of computationally focused academic programs like the EAM concentration, reflects a deliberate and discernible pivot by the school towards a more quantitative and computational approach to environmental science. This evolution positions NSOE to effectively leverage the power of data science and AI in tackling complex environmental challenges.

## **VII. Ethical AI and Responsible Conduct of Research**

As Duke University expands its capabilities and applications of AI, particularly in sensitive areas like natural resource management which can have broad societal and environmental implications, a strong framework for ethical AI and responsible conduct of research (RCR) is paramount.

### **A. Duke's Framework for AI Ethics and Governance**

Duke University is actively developing and implementing a multi-layered approach to AI ethics and governance. The university's overarching **AI Framework** emphasizes ethical responsibility as one of its core pillars, alongside interdisciplinary collaboration and cutting-edge research.75 This high-level commitment is put into practice through initiatives like the **Triangle AI Summit**, which is rooted in this framework and designed to foster critical examination of the ethical, social, humanitarian, and environmental implications of AI.75

Academic programs at Duke also address these ethical dimensions directly. The university offers a **Master of Arts in Applied Ethics & Policy**, which specifically prepares students to tackle pressing ethical challenges of our time, including AI governance and data privacy.81 This program signifies dedicated scholarly focus and expertise in the practical application of ethical principles to emerging technologies.

At the school level, **Trinity College of Arts & Sciences** has issued specific **guidelines on the ethical and responsible use of generative AI tools**.79 These guidelines aim to provide practical advice to faculty and students, focusing on maintaining academic integrity, ensuring the privacy and security of institutional data, and navigating the complexities of using rapidly evolving AI technologies in an academic context.79

Furthermore, the **Duke Office of Research Initiatives** provides specific **guidance for researchers on using Generative AI (GenAI) tools** in their work.60 This guidance addresses various aspects of the research lifecycle, from idea development and proposal writing to manuscript preparation and data generation, helping researchers make informed and ethical decisions when incorporating these powerful new tools.60

### **B. Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) Training Requirements for Graduate Students**

Complementing the AI-specific ethical frameworks, Duke University has a long-standing and comprehensive Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) training program, which is mandatory for all graduate students.

**RCR training is a formal requirement for every master's and PhD student enrolled in The Graduate School**.82 This universal mandate ensures that all graduate students receive foundational training in research ethics, academic standards, and the responsible handling of scholarly challenges. The RCR training program at Duke is designed to meet the requirements of the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 and aims to engage students in ethical decision-making through realistic scenarios and active learning, led by faculty and staff experts.83

The RCR requirements are tiered based on degree and discipline:

* **Master's students** are required to complete 6 hours of RCR training. This typically includes 4 hours during their orientation and an additional 2-hour RCR forum attended before graduation.82  
* **PhD students** in most disciplines, including those in the Nicholas School of the Environment and the Pratt School of Engineering, are required to complete 12 hours of RCR training. PhD students in basic medical sciences have an 18-hour requirement.82 This training is typically completed within the first four years of study and includes sessions during orientation as well as ongoing RCR forums offered by The Graduate School throughout the academic year.82

Duke has a history of prioritizing RCR training, with requirements for PhD students in science and engineering disciplines, including NSOE and Pratt, dating back to the late 1990s, and expanding to all doctoral students in 2003\.83 While the Graduate School leads the primary RCR training through orientations and forums, other approved training opportunities, potentially including departmental offerings, can contribute to fulfilling these requirements with advance approval.82 For instance, faculty in the Pratt School of Engineering, like Daniel Vallero, have been involved in co-leading RCR forums.85

The Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI Program) is a recognized platform for RCR education at Duke, particularly for undergraduate students. Undergraduates supported by federally sponsored research programs or those involved in Duke Health Institutional Review Board (IRB) protocols are required to complete an RCR CITI online course, which includes mandatory modules on mentoring, research misconduct, data management, and a Duke-specific case study, plus an elective module.86 CITI Program's RCR Basic courses cover core topics relevant to all research disciplines.87 While National Institutes of Health (NIH) policy often discourages RCR training programs that rely *entirely* on online instruction for certain researchers, CITI courses can effectively complement in-person or interactive training sessions.87 For Duke graduate students in NSOE and Pratt, the primary mechanism for fulfilling RCR requirements appears to be the Graduate School-led orientations and interactive forums, rather than a primary reliance on CITI modules, though CITI may serve as a supplemental resource or be used in specific contexts.

This multi-layered approach, combining university-wide AI ethics frameworks, specialized academic programs in applied ethics, school-level guidelines for AI tools, and comprehensive RCR training for all graduate students, demonstrates Duke's commitment to fostering a research environment where AI and other advanced technologies are developed and applied responsibly and ethically.

## **VIII. Synthesis and Future Outlook**

Duke University is demonstrably cultivating a dynamic and expanding ecosystem at the confluence of natural resources science and artificial intelligence. The institution's strengths are multifaceted, stemming from the Nicholas School of the Environment's robust, increasingly quantitative programs, complemented by deep expertise in AI, machine learning, and data science within the Departments of Computer Science and Statistical Science, and the applied AI focus of the Pratt School of Engineering. Dedicated faculty and their specialized research labs are actively pioneering the use of AI and advanced computational methods to address critical environmental challenges, spanning marine conservation, terrestrial ecology, climate change, and sustainable energy systems.
