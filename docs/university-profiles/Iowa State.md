# **Iowa State University** 

Iowa State University (ISU) is a public, R1 land-grant research institution. Its Society of American Foresters (SAF) accredited forestry program is situated within the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (CALS), specifically administered by the Department of Natural Resource Ecology and Management (NREM).1 This assessment evaluates the AI readiness of the ISU forestry program by integrating specific findings from institutional documents, course catalogs, faculty profiles, and strategic materials. The analysis confirms an initial assessment placing the program in the **Developing** category regarding AI readiness, while highlighting significant institutional resources and specific strengths within NREM that provide substantial potential for advancement toward the **Leader** category.

## **Executive Summary**

The location of the forestry program within NREM and CALS provides a distinct institutional context. NREM itself represents a consolidation of faculty from previously separate departments, including Forestry and Animal Ecology, with a stated mission dedicated to the understanding, effective management, and sustainable use of renewable natural resources through teaching, research, and extension.3 The department aims to be a preferred provider of graduates in fisheries, forestry, and wildlife management, embracing a broad disciplinary scope from organisms to landscapes and natural to managed ecosystems.3 This multidisciplinary environment within NREM could foster integrated approaches to resource management challenges, potentially incorporating diverse datasets and analytical techniques relevant to AI.

Operating within a major R1 land-grant university provides inherent advantages, including access to significant research infrastructure, potential for substantial funding, and a large pool of expertise across various colleges, particularly the strong College of Engineering and Department of Statistics noted in the initial assessment. The program's home within CALS directly connects it to ISU's core land-grant mission and the state's vital agricultural sector.2 This linkage facilitates access to resources and collaborations relevant to agricultural sciences, such as the AI Institute for Resilient Agriculture (AIIRA) hosted at ISU.5 However, this context may also present challenges, as forestry must align its priorities and compete for resources within a large college where agriculture is the dominant focus. The long-standing SAF accreditation, held since 1935, signifies a commitment to established professional forestry standards 1, which must now be balanced with the need to integrate emerging technologies like AI.

## **Curriculum Integration**

The AI readiness of the forestry program's curriculum hinges on its ability to equip students with foundational quantitative skills and provide pathways to advanced computational competencies, including AI and machine learning (ML).

Foundational Quantitative & Geospatial Skills:  
The Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Forestry curriculum mandates several courses that build a foundation in quantitative analysis and geospatial techniques. Core requirements include FOR 2030 Resource Measurements/Evaluation, which introduces quantification techniques in forestry 6, and FOR 4510 Forest Resource Economics and Quantitative Methods, explicitly focusing on mathematical and statistical applications in the field.6 Students must also complete introductory statistics (STAT 1010 or STAT 1040\) 6 and select an advanced mathematics elective from options including calculus (MATH 1510, MATH 1600, MATH 1650), NREM 2400 Quantitative Problem Solving in Natural Resources, or intermediate statistics (STAT 3010).6 Notably, NREM 2400 provides direct experience with applied quantitative problem-solving using computer data processing and modeling within a natural resources context.11  
Geospatial skills are formally introduced through NREM 3450 Natural Resource Photogrammetry and Geographic Information Systems, covering aerial photo interpretation and foundational GIS operations using ArcGIS.8 Program learning outcomes state that graduates should be proficient in technical skills including measurements, computer usage, inventory, economic analysis, data and situation analysis, and ecosystem assessment, reflecting the importance of these foundational competencies.1

Advanced Geospatial/Remote Sensing Options:  
Students can pursue more advanced geospatial skills through electives, particularly within the Forest Ecosystem Management option.8 NREM 4460 Integrating GPS and GIS for Natural Resource Management builds on the foundational GIS course, focusing on GPS data collection and integration.8 Furthermore, the NREM department offers NREM 4890 Survey of Remote Sensing Technologies and the associated NREM 4890L Satellite Remote Sensing Laboratory, which cover principles and analysis techniques for various sensors including multispectral, hyperspectral, radar, and lidar.11 While these are general NREM courses, they represent potential electives for forestry students seeking deeper remote sensing knowledge, contingent upon their chosen specialization track and advisor consultation.8  
AI/Data Science/Machine Learning Integration:  
Based on the available curriculum documents and course listings, there is minimal explicit integration of AI, ML, or advanced data science topics within the required forestry coursework.6 The primary mechanism for forestry students to access such content appears to be through the "quantitative-analytical techniques" emphasis area available within the Forest Ecosystem Management option.8 This pathway allows students, guided by their advisors, to select relevant elective courses offered elsewhere in the university.  
Iowa State University offers substantial resources in these areas, including a B.S. in Data Science 13, an Artificial Intelligence Minor 14, and numerous pertinent courses across departments. Examples include DS 3030 Concepts and Applications of Machine Learning, COMS 4720 Principles of Artificial Intelligence, COMS 4740 Introduction to Machine Learning, CPRE 4190 Software Tools for Large Scale Data Analysis, EE 4250 Machine learning: A Signal Processing Perspective, and IE 4830 Data Mining.13

A noticeable gap exists between the solid quantitative and geospatial foundation provided *within* the standard forestry curriculum and the advanced computational skills offered *across* the university. Successfully bridging this gap relies heavily on individual student motivation, proactive academic advising, and the flexibility afforded by elective choices, primarily within the Forest Ecosystem Management option. Accessing these advanced courses often requires prerequisites, such as the full calculus sequence (MATH 1650, 1660, 2650), linear algebra (MATH 2070), and programming (COMS 1270, 2270), which are core to the Data Science B.S..13 The standard forestry math pathway, typically starting with MATH 1400 College Algebra and allowing electives like MATH 1510 (Calculus for Business/Social Sciences) or NREM 2400 6, may not directly fulfill the prerequisites for upper-level Computer Science or Data Science courses without additional coursework. This potential mismatch underscores the need for careful planning and advising for forestry students aiming to specialize in quantitative or AI-related areas. The availability of the AI Minor 16 and Data Science major 13 represents a significant university asset, but practical accessibility for forestry students requires navigating these prerequisite pathways.

*Note: Prerequisites listed are illustrative and may vary or have alternatives. Accessibility as an elective depends on meeting prerequisites, course capacity, and advisor approval.*

## **Faculty Expertise**

The expertise residing within the NREM faculty is a critical component of the forestry program's AI readiness. The department houses a diverse faculty covering conservation, forest management, aquatic systems, wildlife, sustainability, and human interactions.19

Geospatial & Modeling Expertise:  
Several NREM faculty members possess deep expertise directly applicable to AI in forestry and natural resources.

* **Peter Wolter**, Associate Professor, specializes in forest and landscape ecology, environmental monitoring, satellite remote sensing, and GIS.21 His research explicitly involves using multi-temporal and multi-resolution satellite data (including Landsat, SPOT, Radar, PALSAR) combined with ground data to model and map forest biophysical characteristics such as species abundance, tree size, basal area, and crown closure.21 This work supports landscape-level analyses of insect outbreaks and the development of parameters crucial for fire behavior modeling, like canopy bulk density.21 He investigates methods linking spectral change to physical changes like defoliation and explores the use of airborne lidar data to calibrate satellite-based estimation models.23 This type of research, focused on extracting detailed forest information from large, complex remote sensing datasets, aligns directly with the capabilities of AI and ML for image analysis, pattern recognition, and predictive modeling.  
* **Lisa Schulte Moore**, a Charles F. Curtiss Distinguished Professor, holds joint appointments as Co-Director of the Bioeconomy Institute and Director of C-CHANGE.25 Her expertise spans agroecology, bioeconomy, forestry, landscape ecology, and social-ecological systems.25 Her research focuses on integrating perennial vegetation (e.g., prairie strips) into agricultural landscapes to achieve multiple societal goals, including improved water quality, soil health, wildlife habitat, and new bioeconomy markets.25 She co-founded the STRIPS project and developed the PEWI decision-support tool.25 Her leadership in large, interdisciplinary initiatives like C-CHANGE and her involvement with the AI Institute for Resilient Agriculture (AIIRA) 28 position her at the intersection of landscape management, bioeconomy, and potentially AI applications for optimizing complex systems.  
* **John Tyndall**, Professor, is a natural resource economist whose work integrates economic and social analysis into forestry and agriculture.30 He specializes in the financial and economic assessment of environmental quality management practices, ecosystem services valuation, and conservation adoption in managed landscapes.30 His research involves developing integrated financial and spatial modeling approaches and decision support tools, such as the Agricultural Conservation Planning Framework Financial and Nutrient Reduction Tool (ACPF FiNRT) and the Prairie and Tree Planting Tool (PT2), to aid conservation planners and landowners.30 This expertise in quantitative modeling and decision support provides a strong basis for incorporating AI techniques to enhance predictive accuracy, optimize conservation investments, and analyze complex economic-environmental trade-offs.

AI/Data Science Expertise:  
While the core NREM faculty demonstrate strong foundational expertise, the provided materials do not indicate widespread publication or primary research focus on developing novel AI or ML methodologies within the department itself. The pathway for deep engagement with AI research appears to be strongly oriented towards collaboration. Lisa Schulte Moore's roles in the Bioeconomy Institute and AIIRA exemplify this connection to broader university AI initiatives.25 AIIRA, in particular, brings together ISU faculty from various departments (including Agronomy, Engineering, Computer Science, Statistics) with explicit AI/ML expertise applied to agriculture – such as Soumik Sarkar (ML/AI for plant science), George Kantor (field robotics, perception), Aarti Singh (ML/AI), and Lizhi Wang (optimization) – creating a rich pool of potential collaborators for NREM faculty.28 The presence of a Data Analyst II (Matt Stephenson) on the NREM staff provides internal support for data management and analysis tasks, facilitating applied research but distinct from faculty-led AI methods development.36  
The existing strengths in geospatial analysis (Wolter), landscape ecology and bioeconomy (Schulte Moore), and resource economics and modeling (Tyndall) represent significant assets. This expertise forms a robust foundation for *applying* AI techniques to critical forestry and natural resource problems. For instance, Wolter's remote sensing data is ideal for ML-based classification and change detection; Schulte Moore's systems integration work aligns with AI's optimization capabilities; and Tyndall's decision support tools could be enhanced with AI-driven predictive analytics. However, advancing NREM's AI research capacity seems likely to rely on leveraging the expertise housed in other ISU departments and the institutional structures provided by AIIRA and the Translational AI Center (TrAC), focusing on applying AI to solve NREM domain problems rather than developing fundamental AI methods internally.

**Table 2: Selected NREM Faculty with Expertise Relevant to AI in Forestry/Natural Resources**

| Faculty Member | Rank / Title | Key Expertise Areas | Examples of Relevant Research / Activities | Potential AI Applications / Links | Snippet(s) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Peter T. Wolter | Associate Professor | Forest/Landscape Ecology, Environmental Monitoring, Satellite Remote Sensing, GIS | Modeling forest biophysical parameters (species, density, structure) from multi-sensor satellite/ground data; Fire behavior modeling inputs; Insect outbreak dynamics; Defoliation monitoring; Lidar calibration | ML for image classification/segmentation; Time-series analysis for change detection; Predictive modeling (fire risk, insect spread); Sensor fusion techniques | 21 |

## **2.9.4. Technological Infrastructure**

Access to adequate technological infrastructure is fundamental for AI readiness. Iowa State University provides substantial resources in high-performance computing (HPC), complemented by departmental and university-level support for geospatial analysis and AI software.

High-Performance Computing (HPC):  
ISU maintains significant, centrally managed HPC resources available to the university research community.39 The primary cluster, 'Nova', features a heterogeneous architecture with multi-core Intel (Skylake, Icelake) and AMD (EPYC) processors.40 Nodes offer substantial memory, ranging from 192GB to 1TB or even 3TB on specialized high-memory nodes, along with fast NVMe local storage (up to 11TB on some nodes) and high-speed EDR (100 Gbit) InfiniBand interconnects for parallel processing.40  
Crucially for AI and ML workloads, the Nova cluster includes a considerable number of GPU accelerators. This includes nodes equipped with NVIDIA Tesla V100 (32GB) cards and, significantly, a large contingent of nodes featuring multiple NVIDIA A100 (80GB) GPUs, which are state-of-the-art for AI training and inference.40 The HPC-Class partition, supporting instructional computing and thesis development, also provides access to nodes with A100 GPUs.40 In total, the cluster boasts over 13,000 cores, approximately 135TB of memory, and over 100 high-end NVIDIA GPU cards (V100 and A100).41 This computational power is supported by large-scale shared storage, including over 200TB of shared scratch space and 2.5PB of long-term RAID-6 NFS disk space.40

Access to these resources is managed through a request system 41 and is designed to be affordable and sustainable, supported by NSF MRI grants and institutional/college contributions.39 The university explicitly aims to provide development resources even for researchers without existing grant funding.41 User access is facilitated by tools like Open OnDemand, which provides a web-based portal for managing jobs, accessing files, opening terminal shells, and running interactive applications such as RStudio, MATLAB, and virtual desktops, lowering the barrier to entry for users less familiar with traditional command-line HPC environments.42 This robust, well-supported, and accessible HPC infrastructure, particularly its strong GPU capacity, represents a major strength for ISU and ensures that computational power should not be a limiting factor for NREM faculty or students pursuing AI-related research.

GIS/Remote Sensing Labs:  
While specific details on dedicated NREM departmental labs are limited in the provided materials, the curriculum necessitates access to relevant resources. Courses like NREM 3450 (GIS) and NREM 4460 (GPS/GIS) include laboratory components 11, implying the availability of necessary software (ArcGIS is explicitly mentioned for NREM 3450 11\) and hardware, likely through departmental facilities or university-wide computer labs. A potentially significant development is a CALS strategic initiative exploring the creation of an ISU Remote Sensing and Imaging Laboratory.43 If realized, this could centralize and enhance advanced capabilities in data acquisition, processing, and analysis relevant to forestry and AI applications, potentially addressing any current gaps in specialized departmental infrastructure.  
AI Software/Platforms:  
The university provides institutional access to certain AI tools, such as Microsoft Copilot (enterprise version with data protection) and Adobe Firefly (image generation), and is evaluating others like ChatGPT Edu.44 Access to more specialized AI/ML software libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) and platforms typically occurs through the HPC environment, where users can leverage pre-installed modules or containerized environments. Research centers like AIIRA and TrAC likely utilize and potentially provide access to specific software stacks relevant to their domains (e.g., agricultural modeling platforms, robotics simulation tools).

## **Strategic Vision & Planning**

The strategic direction set by the university, college, and department influences the environment for AI integration.

University Level:  
Iowa State University's 2022-2031 Strategic Plan outlines broad aspirations, including being the most student-centric leading research university, cultivating diversity and inclusion, fostering lifelong learning, creating opportunities, and being a trusted partner for innovation.46 The plan incorporates a dynamic process for soliciting and funding new strategic initiatives annually to ensure agility.46 Artificial intelligence is clearly recognized as a strategic priority. Campus-wide AI efforts are coordinated through a task force with subcommittees addressing Policy, Teaching and Learning, Research, Communications, and Operational Efficiencies.45 The university provides guidance on responsible Generative AI use 44 and makes AI tools available to the campus community.45 This top-down strategic emphasis creates a supportive ecosystem for departments like NREM to engage with AI.  
College Level (CALS):  
The formal CALS strategic plan is currently under review.48 However, CALS units are actively developing strategic initiatives aligned with university priorities.43 These initiatives span areas like curriculum development, faculty/postdoc training, research infrastructure (e.g., the potential Remote Sensing Lab), and partnerships.43 Historical CALS goals emphasized enhancing natural resource research and extension.3 While specific CALS plans regarding AI are not detailed, the structure for developing responsive initiatives exists.  
Department Level (NREM):  
The most recent NREM strategic plan readily available dates from 2007-2012.4 This plan articulated a vision centered on understanding, managing, and sustaining renewable natural resources through integrated teaching, research (spanning basic to applied "solution science" and human dimensions), and extension, with a strong emphasis on serving stakeholders and producing high-quality graduates.3 It highlighted the department's multidisciplinary nature and commitment to collaboration.3 While these foundational principles remain relevant (current mission/vision statements are accessible 50), this plan predates the widespread emergence and impact of modern AI. Consequently, NREM's specific strategic positioning regarding the opportunities and challenges presented by AI is not evident from the available documentation. Effective integration of AI into NREM's teaching, research, and extension missions would benefit from updated departmental strategic planning, likely developed in alignment with the ongoing CALS initiatives 43 and the university's broader AI focus.45  
Related Departments:  
The Department of Computer Science explicitly identifies Artificial Intelligence and Data Science as key areas in its strategic plan, aiming for national/international recognition and leadership in cross-disciplinary computing research.51 This signifies strong institutional capacity and potential partnership opportunities for NREM.  
Overall, the strong university-level strategic focus on AI provides significant tailwinds. However, translating this university-level support into tangible progress within the forestry program requires proactive planning and strategic alignment at the NREM department level, which is not currently visible in the provided strategic documents.

## **Funding & Resources**

Financial resources are essential for supporting AI research, infrastructure, and educational integration. Iowa State, as an R1 land-grant institution, benefits from state and federal funding streams \[Initial Assessment\]. The university administration also allocates central funds for strategic initiatives identified through its planning process, investing $14.4 million in the first two years of the current plan.46

Specific funding for AI initiatives is substantial. The AI Institute for Resilient Agriculture (AIIRA) operates under a five-year, $20 million grant co-funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA).52 The Translational AI Center (TrAC) also leverages federal funding and provides internal seed grants to stimulate AI research across campus.55 The university's HPC infrastructure is supported through a combination of user contributions (often from grants) and significant external funding, including NSF Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) grants.41 Research activities utilizing ISU's HPC resources account for approximately $3.5 million in grant funding annually from agencies like DOE, NSF, and NIH.41

Within CALS and NREM, faculty likely secure external grants for research in agriculture and natural resources, as suggested by the active research programs of faculty like Wolter, Schulte Moore, and Tyndall.21 However, the documentation does not detail specific funding allocated *internally* by CALS or NREM explicitly for AI integration efforts, such as developing new AI-focused courses, providing faculty training in AI tools, or creating AI-specific educational resources.

Therefore, while substantial funding exists at ISU for AI *research* (via AIIRA, TrAC, and leveraging HPC in external grants) and *infrastructure* (HPC), funding for AI *integration* into the NREM curriculum and broader departmental capacity building appears less defined. NREM faculty have clear pathways to fund AI research projects, especially through collaboration with the established AI centers. However, resources for pedagogical development or faculty upskilling in AI may depend more heavily on securing internal CALS/NREM budget allocations or successfully competing for university-level strategic initiative funding.46

## **Industry & External Partnerships**

Partnerships with industry, government agencies, and other organizations are vital for grounding research in real-world applications, facilitating technology transfer, and providing experiential learning opportunities for students. ISU, particularly through CALS, maintains strong connections with the agricultural sector \[Initial Assessment\]. These connections are being actively leveraged in the AI space. AIIRA, for example, explicitly engages a wide range of stakeholders, including agricultural companies, government agencies (USDA), commodity groups, and other universities.5 Similarly, TrAC interacts with industry partners and startups through its Fee Acquired Service Through TrAC (FAST-TrAC) program.55

Within NREM, there is a historical emphasis on building mutually productive relationships with stakeholders such as landowners, state and federal resource agencies (e.g., collaborations with the Iowa Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit, USDA ARS, USFS), conservation groups, and industry.3 These existing relationships form a valuable network.

However, the provided materials do not highlight specific partnerships focused explicitly on applying AI within the *forestry* domain. The potential clearly exists to bridge NREM's traditional forestry stakeholder network with the university's AI capabilities and partnership frameworks established by AIIRA and TrAC. For example, NREM could potentially collaborate with state forestry agencies or forest products companies on projects using AI for enhanced forest inventory from remote sensing data, early pest or disease detection, wildfire risk modeling, or optimizing timber harvesting logistics, drawing on the expertise of faculty like Wolter and the infrastructure of the AI centers. At the national level, ISU's participation in networks like the NIST US AI Safety Institute Consortium (via TrAC) 55 and the NSF AI Institutes program 58 connects the university to broader AI developments and potential collaborators.

## **Data Practices & Governance**

Effective and ethical use of AI relies on sound data practices and clear governance structures. At the university level, ISU's Research IT provides guidance on the use of Generative AI tools, emphasizing the user's responsibility for verifying information, understanding tool limitations, and critically, protecting data privacy by avoiding the input of sensitive, proprietary, or personal information.44

Large-scale research initiatives like AIIRA inherently demand sophisticated data management practices. The institute's goal of creating predictive digital twins necessitates fusing diverse data streams (e.g., sensor data, genomic data, environmental data).52 AIIRA's collaboration with the University of Arizona's CyVerse, which specializes in cyberinfrastructure for life sciences 29, suggests access to robust data management platforms and expertise.

Within NREM, the employment of a Data Analyst II indicates some level of internal capacity for handling and analyzing research data.36 Faculty research involving field data collection and modeling implies the existence of established data collection protocols.21 However, there is no mention in the provided documents of specific initiatives within NREM focused on creating curated, high-quality, AI-ready datasets specifically for broader use in forestry research or education. While AIIRA generates vast amounts of data, its primary focus is agricultural systems 5, although the methods and platforms might be adaptable.

Overall, while university-level guidance on GenAI use is emerging 44 and major projects like AIIRA likely operate under robust data management plans dictated by their scope and funding agencies, specific data governance policies tailored to AI research within NREM are not detailed. The department's current capacity appears geared towards supporting individual faculty research needs 36 rather than undertaking large-scale efforts to curate benchmark datasets for the forestry AI community. Data governance likely adheres to general university research policies and project-specific requirements.

## **Ethical Considerations**

Iowa State University demonstrates a strong institutional commitment to addressing the ethical dimensions of artificial intelligence across its missions. Multiple units and initiatives contribute to a comprehensive framework. The university's Ethics Hub provides expertise on the ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI) of AI and emerging technologies, engaging in research collaborations and offering consultations.60 The Translational AI Center (TrAC) includes Ethics & Policy in AI as one of its core research thrusts.56

In the educational sphere, the Center for Excellence in Learning and Teaching (CELT) offers workshops and resources for faculty on establishing ethical AI policies for their courses, guiding students on responsible AI use, and incorporating AI into teaching effectively.61 The University Library also contributes through workshops discussing AI ethics in the context of higher education and academic libraries.63 University-wide guidance on responsible GenAI use in research 44 and teaching 62 is available, complemented by resources on academic integrity.64 The AI Minor includes a course on the Philosophy of Technology (PHIL 3430\) 16, and the Philosophy department engages broadly in ethics education.60

Within the NREM forestry curriculum, there is a general learning outcome related to ethics, requiring graduates to identify and evaluate their beliefs and values in relation to professional and societal ethical standards.8 However, specific integration of *AI ethics* topics – such as algorithmic bias in environmental monitoring, data privacy for landowners using sensor technology, the potential impact of automation on forestry jobs, or equitable access to AI-driven management tools – is not explicitly mentioned in the forestry course descriptions.

The research context also incorporates ethical dimensions. AIIRA, for instance, includes research focused on understanding the social, behavioral, and business factors influencing the adoption of AI technologies in agriculture, utilizing both quantitative and qualitative methods to explore potential catalysts and barriers.52

This extensive institutional framework for AI ethics provides a strong foundation and readily available resources for the NREM department. The primary task for NREM is to actively leverage these university-wide resources to infuse AI ethics considerations specifically into the forestry curriculum, research practices, and outreach activities, building upon the program's existing general ethics requirement.

## **2.9.10. Overall Assessment & Insights**

Based on the analysis of available institutional data, curriculum, faculty profiles, infrastructure, and strategic documents, Iowa State University's forestry program, housed within NREM, is assessed as **Developing** in its AI readiness. However, the program possesses considerable strengths and resides within an institution making significant investments in AI, providing clear potential to advance towards the **Leader** category.

Strengths:  
The program benefits from a solid curricular foundation in essential quantitative methods, GIS, and remote sensing principles.6 Within NREM, there is significant faculty expertise directly relevant to AI applications, particularly in advanced geospatial analysis and modeling (Wolter), landscape ecology, agroecology, and bioeconomy (Schulte Moore), and natural resource economics coupled with decision support tool development (Tyndall).21 Furthermore, NREM faculty and students have access to robust university-wide HPC infrastructure, including state-of-the-art GPU resources well-suited for computationally intensive AI/ML tasks, with accessible usage policies.40 Critically, ISU hosts major AI initiatives, including the $20M AIIRA focused on agriculture and resilience 5, the cross-cutting Translational AI Center (TrAC) 55, strong academic programs in Data Science and AI 13, and a proactive institutional focus on AI ethics.45 The university's strategic plan actively encourages innovation and provides mechanisms for funding new initiatives.46  
Areas for Development:  
Despite these strengths, key areas require development for the forestry program to fully leverage AI. Explicit integration of AI, ML, and advanced data science concepts and tools within the required forestry curriculum remains limited; student access largely depends on pursuing specific elective tracks (like quantitative-analytical techniques) and navigating prerequisites for courses offered outside NREM.8 An updated NREM-specific strategic plan that explicitly outlines goals and strategies for AI integration in teaching, research, and extension is not apparent from the available documents.3 While NREM faculty possess strong application-domain expertise, AI research within the department appears primarily collaborative and application-driven, rather than focused on developing novel AI methods internally. Finally, although potential exists, specific industry or agency partnerships focused on AI applications in forestry are not yet highlighted.  
Path Forward:  
The most promising path forward for enhancing AI readiness within ISU's forestry program involves strategically leveraging the university's considerable assets. Deepening collaborations between NREM faculty (particularly those with strong modeling and geospatial expertise) and researchers within AIIRA, TrAC, Computer Science, Statistics, and Engineering is crucial. This collaborative approach allows NREM to focus on applying cutting-edge AI to forestry problems without needing to replicate extensive AI methods development internally.  
Addressing the curriculum gap is also vital. This could involve creating clearer pathways for forestry students to access relevant AI/DS courses, potentially by developing bridge modules, adjusting prerequisites where feasible, or designing interdisciplinary courses co-taught by NREM and AI/DS faculty. Formalizing the "quantitative-analytical techniques" track within the Forest Ecosystem Management option with specific AI/DS course recommendations would provide clearer guidance.8

Developing or updating the NREM strategic plan to explicitly incorporate AI goals would signal commitment, guide resource allocation, and ensure alignment with university-wide priorities.45 This plan should consider how AI can enhance NREM's teaching, research, and extension missions.

Finally, NREM should actively explore opportunities within AIIRA. Although AIIRA's primary focus is agriculture 5, the foundational AI technologies being developed (e.g., digital twins, advanced sensing, spatiotemporal modeling, optimization) are highly transferable to forestry challenges.52 Seeking forestry-specific application projects within AIIRA and leveraging its educational components 52 could significantly accelerate AI adoption within the NREM program.

In conclusion, Iowa State University provides a rich environment for its forestry program to embrace AI. The program's foundational strengths in quantitative and geospatial methods, coupled with key faculty expertise and access to exceptional university resources like HPC and major AI institutes (especially AIIRA), create significant potential. Realizing this potential will require deliberate strategic planning within NREM, focused efforts on curriculum integration and bridging, and continued emphasis on fostering the interdisciplinary collaborations necessary to apply advanced AI techniques to the complex challenges of forest science and management.
