# **Louisiana Tech University**

## **1\. Executive Summary**

Louisiana Tech University (LaTech) presents a landscape of established strengths and emerging opportunities at the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI), data science, and natural resource management. The University houses well-regarded programs in Forestry (accredited by the Society of American Foresters through 2031\) and Geographic Information Science (GIS) within the College of Applied & Natural Sciences (ANS), alongside a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Science. Foundational GIS coursework is integrated into these programs. Concurrently, the College of Engineering and Science (COES) and the College of Business offer robust programs and possess significant faculty expertise in Computer Science, Cyber Engineering, AI, Machine Learning (ML), Data Science, and High-Performance Computing (HPC), evidenced by dedicated degree programs, concentrations, graduate certificates, and faculty research activities. LaTech researchers have access to state-level HPC resources via the Louisiana Optical Network Initiative (LONI), including substantial GPU capabilities, supplemented by a local cluster, Cerberus.

Despite these strengths, several areas present opportunities for development. Detailed, publicly accessible curriculum information for key ANS natural resource programs (Forestry, GIS, Environmental Science) appears limited, hindering external assessment of the depth of quantitative, modeling, and AI training embedded within these majors. While foundational GIS is present, pathways for natural resource students to gain advanced computational skills seem underdeveloped or require navigating complex prerequisites in COES courses. Institutionally, there is a lack of documented strategic prioritization specifically focused on integrating AI and data science into natural resource programs, although broader university and state-level goals support innovation and interdisciplinary research. Furthermore, specifics regarding the local Cerberus HPC cluster's capabilities, the supported AI/ML software stack on HPC resources, and dedicated research computing support structures are not clearly defined in available materials. Finally, clear institutional policies addressing the ethical use of AI in research and comprehensive Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) training guidelines extending beyond human subjects research appear underdeveloped or inaccessible.

Key opportunities include leveraging the considerable AI/ML/HPC expertise within COES for interdisciplinary collaborations with ANS domain experts, developing clearer academic pathways for students, aligning with state AI and research initiatives, potentially establishing a dedicated research center, and enhancing the transparency and accessibility of curriculum and infrastructure details. Addressing challenges related to inter-college collaboration, resource allocation for new initiatives, ensuring equitable HPC access and support, and developing clear ethical and RCR policies will be crucial for maximizing LaTech's potential in applying advanced computational methods to natural resource challenges.

## **2\. Introduction**

Section 4 assesses faculty expertise and research activities across pertinent departments. Section 5 evaluates the computational research infrastructure, including HPC resources and software. Section 6 discusses strategic initiatives and collaborative efforts. Section 7 addresses ethical considerations, including AI ethics and RCR training. Finally, Section 8 synthesizes the findings and offers recommendations for future development.

## **3\. Academic Landscape: Natural Resources and AI**

The successful integration of AI and computational methods into natural resource disciplines depends heavily on the university's academic structure, program offerings, and curriculum design. This section examines the relevant academic units at Louisiana Tech, details the natural resource and computational programs, and assesses the current state of computational training within these fields.

### **3.1. Relevant Academic Units**

Two primary colleges at Louisiana Tech house the programs central to this analysis: the **College of Applied & Natural Sciences (ANS)** and the **College of Engineering and Science (COES)**.5

* The **College of Applied & Natural Sciences (ANS)** serves as the primary home for traditional natural resource and life science programs. It includes the **School of Agricultural Sciences & Forestry**, which offers degrees in Forestry, Geographic Information Science (GIS), Agricultural Business, and Animal Science.5 ANS also contains the **School of Biological Sciences**, offering degrees in Biology and Environmental Science.5  
* The **College of Engineering and Science (COES)** houses the core engineering disciplines as well as foundational and advanced programs in computational fields. Relevant programs within COES include Computer Science, Cyber Engineering, Mathematics & Statistics, and various engineering disciplines that contribute to computational modeling and data analysis capabilities.8

This organizational structure, placing core natural resource programs predominantly in ANS and core computational and AI-focused programs primarily in COES, underscores the importance of deliberate inter-college collaboration. Effectively integrating advanced AI techniques, typically developed and taught within COES, into the study and management of natural resources within ANS requires intentional mechanisms such as joint faculty appointments, cross-listed courses, shared research centers, or specifically designed interdisciplinary degree programs. The available documentation does not highlight such mechanisms as a primary organizational feature, suggesting that bridging this structural separation is key to advancing AI applications in natural resource fields at LaTech.

### **3.2. Natural Resource and Related Programs**

Louisiana Tech offers several undergraduate programs focused on natural resources and environmental management, primarily within ANS.

* **Bachelor of Science in Forestry (BSF):** Housed within the School of Agricultural Sciences & Forestry, this program is a cornerstone of LaTech's natural resource offerings.6 It boasts a strong reputation, described as a top program in the South and nationally.14 The BSF offers concentrations in **Forest Management** and **Wildlife Habitat Management**.5 A significant indicator of program quality is its accreditation by the **Society of American Foresters (SAF)**, which is current through 2031\.14 This accreditation ensures the curriculum meets rigorous national standards for forestry education. The Wildlife Habitat Management concentration specifically provides coursework necessary for students seeking certification through **The Wildlife Society (TWS)**, although explicit program-level TWS certification or accreditation is not confirmed in the reviewed materials.16 The curriculum requires foundational courses like FOR 200 (Forest Measurements) and **GISC 250 (Intro to Geographic Inform Sys)**, the latter being a prerequisite for the mandatory sophomore Summer Field Session.14 However, detailed curriculum maps or course descriptions specifying the extent of training in advanced quantitative methods (beyond basic measurements), ecological modeling, or remote sensing within the Forestry program itself were not readily accessible.14 Students must maintain a "C" or better in core forestry courses.14  
* **Bachelor of Science in Geographic Information Science (BS):** Also located in the School of Agricultural Sciences & Forestry, this program focuses on the application of geospatial technology and data analysis for management and planning.5 It aims to equip students with skills applicable to surveying, cartography, mapping, and research database management.18 An Undergraduate Certificate in GIS is also available.18 Despite its relevance to data-driven natural resource management, specific curriculum details, including courses covering advanced remote sensing, spatial statistics, programming languages commonly used in GIS (like Python or R), spatial database management, advanced modeling techniques, or potential AI/ML applications in geospatial analysis, were consistently unavailable in the reviewed documents, often indicated by "Loading..." placeholders or links to inaccessible catalog pages.18  
* **Bachelor of Science in Environmental Science (BS):** Offered through the School of Biological Sciences, this program provides a multi-disciplinary curriculum drawing from ANS units.5 Core requirements include foundational courses in environmental science (ENSC 211, ENSC 212), ecology (ENSC 313), soil science (ENSC 310), water quality management (ENSC 450), and an introduction to GIS (GISC 250).19 The program allows for directed electives, offering flexibility for students to pursue minors or specific career interests, potentially including further GIS coursework.19 Similar to Forestry and GIS, specific details regarding advanced courses within the Environmental Science major focused on data analysis, statistics beyond an introductory level, environmental modeling, or other computational methods were not found in the available materials.10 A grade of "C" or better is required in key science and GIS courses.19  
* **Related Minors/Certificates:** LaTech also offers complementary credentials including an Environmental Science Minor 20, an Environmental Sustainability Undergraduate Certificate 24, a Forestry Minor 25, and the aforementioned GIS Undergraduate Certificate.18

The presence of foundational GIS courses (GISC 250\) within the Forestry and Environmental Science curricula indicates a baseline level of integration of geospatial technology.14 However, the apparent lack of clearly defined, advanced coursework *within these specific majors* covering quantitative ecology, sophisticated modeling techniques, advanced remote sensing analysis, or programming tailored for natural resource applications suggests a potential gap. Students aiming for careers heavily reliant on these computational skills would likely need to strategically utilize electives or pursue minors, drawing courses from the GIS program itself, or from departments within COES such as Mathematics, Statistics, or Computer Science. This necessity highlights the importance of robust academic advising to guide students through potentially complex inter-departmental curriculum planning.

A significant impediment encountered during this assessment was the difficulty in accessing detailed, up-to-date curriculum information online for these core ANS programs. Links often led to inaccessible catalog pages or displayed "Loading..." messages indefinitely.14 While detailed curriculum sheets were available for COES programs like Computer Science and Cyber Engineering 11, similar readily accessible documents (e.g., curriculum maps, checklists, comprehensive course descriptions with prerequisites) for Forestry, GIS, and Environmental Science were not located within the reviewed materials.14 This lack of transparency makes it challenging for external parties (and potentially prospective students or internal planners) to accurately gauge the depth of computational training offered and hinders efforts to map interdisciplinary pathways.

### **3.3. Computer Science, Engineering, and Data Science Programs (Capacity for AI/Computational Methods)**

Louisiana Tech possesses considerable capacity in AI, data science, and computational methods, primarily concentrated within COES and the College of Business.

* **Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS):** This COES program provides foundational and advanced training in computing.8 It offers several concentrations relevant to AI and data-intensive applications, including **Cloud Computing and Big Data** and **Cyber Security**.8 Key courses identified in the curriculum include:  
  * **CSC 475 Artificial Intelligence:** Covers foundational aspects of building intelligent entities, focusing on ML algorithms for classification, pattern recognition, feature engineering, and applications in data mining, web searching, etc..35 Prerequisite: CSC 325 (Advanced Data Structures & Algorithms).28  
  * **CSC 493 Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery:** Prerequisite: CSC 325\.28  
  * **CSC 498 Advanced Data Mining, Fusion, and Application:** Prerequisite: CSC 325\.28  
  * **CSC 452 Distributed and Cloud Computing:** Covers concepts fundamental to big data processing and HPC. Prerequisite: CSC 345 (Operating Systems).28  
  * The curriculum utilizes **Python** 37 and requires **STAT 405 Statistical Methods**.28 The prerequisite structure, particularly the reliance on CSC 325 for upper-level AI and data mining courses, indicates that substantial foundational computer science coursework is necessary, potentially posing a barrier for natural resource students seeking isolated AI/ML courses without pursuing a CS minor or significant elective planning.  
* **Bachelor of Science in Cyber Engineering (BSCY):** Also housed in COES, this program integrates computer science and electrical engineering principles with a focus on security.8 The curriculum includes foundational CS, math, physics, and engineering courses, along with specialized cybersecurity topics and STAT 405\.29 Directed electives offer opportunities for specialization, potentially including AI/ML applications in security.29  
* **Graduate Programs & Certificates:** LaTech offers several graduate-level options for advanced computational training:  
  * **MS in Computer Science (MSCS):** Provides advanced study with thesis, practicum, or coursework-only tracks. Elective options include AI (CSC 475), Data Mining (CSC 579, CSC 580), advanced statistics, and numerical analysis.13 Admission typically requires a CS background or qualifying GRE scores.13  
  * **PhD in Computational Analysis and Modeling (CAM):** An interdisciplinary program requiring core coursework in applied math/statistics and computer science. Research tracks explicitly include High-Performance Computing, Data Science, and Computation/Simulation/Modeling.40  
  * **Graduate Certificate in Data Science:** A 12-credit hour program offered through COES, designed to provide foundational data science skills. Required courses include statistical analysis (INEN 514), database theory (CSC 530), statistical learning using R (STAT 509), and an elective in data analytics tools or cognitive systems engineering.41  
  * **MBA with Business Data Analytics Concentration:** Offered by the College of Business, this concentration combines core MBA coursework with electives such as Advanced Business Analytics (CIS 506), Advanced Financial Analytics (FINC 527), Accounting Analytics (ACCT 520), Research Methods (ECON 551), Advanced Visual Analytics (CIS 507), Advanced Marketing Research (MKTG 533), and Data Analytics in R (ECON 545).42  
  * **MS in Engineering and Technology Management (MSEM) with Data Science Concentration:** This COES program includes courses in operations research, simulation, statistical analysis (including Six Sigma), and statistical learning.44

The existence of these diverse undergraduate and graduate programs, certificates, and concentrations clearly demonstrates substantial institutional capacity and expertise in AI, data science, HPC, and related computational fields at Louisiana Tech. However, these offerings are predominantly located within COES and the College of Business, separate from the natural resource programs in ANS. This separation highlights both an opportunity and a challenge: the expertise and educational infrastructure exist, but effectively leveraging them for natural resource applications necessitates the creation of bridges—whether through interdisciplinary programs, minors, cross-listed courses, targeted advising, or other collaborative mechanisms—to allow natural resource students access to these skills or to enable computational students to apply their expertise to environmental and resource-based problems.

## **5\. Computational Research Infrastructure**

Access to robust computational infrastructure, including HPC resources and relevant software, is essential for conducting research involving AI, ML, and large-scale modeling in natural resources.

### **5.1. High-Performance Computing (HPC) Resources**

Louisiana Tech provides access to HPC resources through both state-level consortia and local facilities.

* **LONI (Louisiana Optical Network Initiative):** LaTech is a participating institution in LONI, a high-speed fiber network connecting supercomputing resources across major Louisiana research universities.79 This grants LaTech researchers access to powerful, centralized HPC systems. Historically, systems like Queen Bee 2 were utilized.79 Currently available LONI systems include QB2, QB3, and the newest system, QB4 (launched 2024).88 These systems offer significant computational power, including substantial numbers of CPU cores and, critically for AI/ML, large numbers of GPUs (e.g., QB3: 16 NVIDIA Volta V100; QB4: 144 NVIDIA A100).88 Access is managed through user accounts and allocation requests.89  
* **Cerberus Cluster:** LaTech also maintains its own local "community cluster" named Cerberus, which is associated with the Center for Applied Physics Studies (CAPS).79 Local clusters often provide easier access or different usage models compared to larger, shared state resources.

However, crucial details about these resources are missing from the readily available documentation. Specific technical specifications for the local Cerberus cluster (e.g., node count, CPU/GPU types and numbers, memory, storage capacity, interconnect fabric) were not found in the reviewed materials.79 Furthermore, information regarding the typical usage patterns or specific allocation sizes for LaTech researchers on the various LONI systems (QB3, QB4) is unclear.79 While LaTech researchers clearly have access to potent state-level HPC infrastructure via LONI, including significant GPU resources well-suited for AI/ML workloads, the lack of accessible details about the local Cerberus cluster and specific LONI usage makes it difficult to fully ascertain the *practical* day-to-day computational capacity readily available to, and utilized by, natural resource researchers at LaTech. Understanding the capabilities and accessibility of Cerberus versus LONI is important for assessing the overall HPC environment.

### **5.2. Available Software Ecosystem**

The utility of HPC hardware depends heavily on the availability and support of relevant software packages.

* **Programming Languages:** **Python** is utilized in the Computer Science curriculum, suggesting familiarity among students and faculty in that area.37 **R** is explicitly used in the Graduate Certificate in Data Science (STAT 509\) and the MBA Business Data Analytics concentration (ECON 545), indicating its availability and use for statistical learning and data analytics.41  
* **AI/ML Libraries:** While specific ML algorithms like Autoencoders and DBScan are mentioned in a physics thesis analyzing CERN data 97, there is no explicit confirmation in the reviewed snippets that common, large-scale AI/ML frameworks such as **TensorFlow, PyTorch, or scikit-learn** are installed, maintained, or officially supported on either the LONI systems or the local Cerberus cluster for general researcher use.  
* **GIS/Spatial Analysis:** GIS software is undoubtedly used, given the BS in GIS program and faculty research.18 However, specific software packages (e.g., ArcGIS Pro, QGIS, ERDAS Imagine) and their availability on HPC resources or through site licenses are not detailed. LONI software documentation found focuses heavily on neuroimaging tools (e.g., BrainSuite, FSL, AFNI, LONI Pipeline) 98, which may have limited direct applicability to natural resource research.  
* **Statistics and Modeling:** Statistical software is used in courses like STAT 405 and graduate-level statistics courses 38, but specific packages (e.g., SAS, SPSS, specialized R libraries) are not listed. MATLAB is mentioned as available at other LONI institutions 87 but not confirmed for LaTech. Computational physics faculty use numerical methods for PDEs.79 Software developed locally, like the HA-OSCAR high-availability cluster software, demonstrates past capability in specialized software development.74  
* **General Policy:** LONI usage policies stipulate that all software must be appropriately licensed and used according to terms.90

A significant gap exists in the readily accessible information regarding a comprehensive catalog of scientific computing software available on LaTech's HPC resources. While foundational languages (Python, R) are present in the academic environment, the confirmed availability and support for standard AI/ML libraries, advanced statistical packages, and domain-specific modeling tools (beyond neuroimaging on LONI) on Cerberus and LONI systems remain unclear.95 This lack of a clear software inventory poses a potential barrier for researchers, particularly those in natural resources, needing specific tools for advanced computational analysis or AI model development on HPC platforms.

### **5.3. Access Policies and Research Support**

Effective utilization of HPC resources also depends on clear access policies and adequate user support.

* **Access Policies:** Access to LONI systems requires a user account, typically sponsored by a faculty member for students and staff, and tied to a LaTech email address.89 Users are bound by policies regarding credential protection, prohibition of account sharing, fair use, data confidentiality, and software licensing.90 Computational time is managed through allocations, though the specifics of the allocation process were not detailed in the reviewed materials.89 User guides for LONI exist, but available links often pointed to general policy or neuroimaging-specific documentation.95 Access policies specific to the local Cerberus cluster were not found.79  
* **Research Support:** Louisiana Tech operates a central **IT Help Desk** providing general technical support.106 The **Computing Center** employs staff including a Director, Manager of Operations, analysts, and operators.108 However, the extent to which these general IT units provide specialized support for *research computing* (e.g., code optimization for HPC, parallel programming assistance, installation and troubleshooting of complex scientific software stacks, AI/ML framework support) is not specified. While LSU (a major LONI hub) offers dedicated Research Enabling Technology Services (RETS), including HPC support and AI consulting 109, it is unclear how much direct support LaTech users receive from LSU or if LaTech possesses an equivalent internal group dedicated to high-level research computing consultation beyond basic IT help.

The standard procedures for obtaining LONI access appear established. However, the lack of easily findable, detailed user guides tailored to diverse scientific domains (beyond neuroimaging) and the ambiguity surrounding the availability of specialized research computing support *at LaTech* for tasks involving HPC and AI/ML could present challenges. Researchers, especially those in ANS who may be less familiar with HPC environments, might face difficulties in effectively leveraging LONI or Cerberus without dedicated, expert assistance in areas like software installation, job scripting, code parallelization, and AI model deployment.

## **6\. Strategic Initiatives and Collaborations**

University strategic plans, major funded projects, and collaborative partnerships indicate institutional priorities and directions related to research and innovation.

### **6.1. University/College Strategic Priorities**

Strategic documents outline Louisiana Tech's overarching goals and those of its relevant colleges.

* **University Level:** Past (Tech 2020\) and current (T2030 Framework) strategic plans emphasize student recruitment, retention, and success; growth in research and innovation; fostering interdisciplinary impact; community engagement; workforce and economic development; and enhancing the university's national prominence.110 The mission highlights quality in teaching, research, creative activity, and public service.111  
* **College of Engineering and Science (COES):** COES strategic initiatives focus on advancing student learning and success, research and economic development, achieving national recognition, promoting diversity, and integrating engineering and science in education and research.114 A major physical manifestation of this strategy is the new $37 million, 128,800 sq ft Integrated Engineering and Science Education building, designed to support enrollment growth and project-based learning.114 COES is also actively recruiting faculty in high-demand areas like cybersecurity combined with AI/ML and IoT.39  
* **College of Applied & Natural Sciences (ANS):** The mission of the School of Agricultural Sciences & Forestry focuses on educating professionals for the sustainable and ethical stewardship of agricultural and natural resources.6 Strategic alignment is mentioned in relation to specific grants (e.g., a parenting academy grant supporting a Healthier Living priority) 116, but a comprehensive, publicly accessible ANS strategic plan detailing priorities for integrating computational methods or AI into its programs was not identified in the reviewed materials.117  
* **State-Level Context:** Louisiana state initiatives provide context and potential drivers for university priorities. The Louisiana Economic Development (LED) strategic plan aims to boost high-wage STEM employment and optimize asset industries.117 The FIRST Louisiana plan targets research capacity building in areas including IT, biotechnology, and translational domains like environment and agriculture.121 Significantly, the state recently launched **Louisiana Innovation (LA.IO)** and announced the **Louisiana Institute for Artificial Intelligence**, focusing on applied AI research, commercialization, workforce development, and policy.122

An analysis of these strategic documents reveals that while Louisiana Tech broadly supports research growth, innovation, and interdisciplinary activities, and COES specifically targets growth in areas like AI and cyber, there is no explicit, documented strategic priority identified at the university or college level (ANS or COES) focused specifically on the *integration of AI and data science into natural resource programs*. The necessary components exist—domain expertise in ANS, computational expertise in COES—but a targeted institutional strategy to bridge them is not apparent in the available plans. However, the emergence of state-level initiatives like FIRST Louisiana and the Louisiana Institute for Artificial Intelligence provides a strong external rationale and potential funding avenues for LaTech to develop such a strategic focus, aligning internal goals with state priorities for economic development and research innovation in critical sectors like environment, agriculture, and AI.

### **6.2. Relevant Research Centers, Institutes, and Major Funded Projects**

Specific centers and funded projects provide concrete examples of research activity and collaboration.

* **Relevant Centers:** As detailed in Section 4.3, key centers include CAPS (Computational Physics/Modeling), CEnIT (IT Innovation), CyAIL & CSC (Cybersecurity/AI), IfM (Micro/Nano Tech & Sensing), the DMML Lab (Data Mining/ML), and the Wildlife Lab.16 As noted previously, no single center appears dedicated specifically to the AI and Natural Resources intersection.84  
* **National Science Foundation (NSF) Funded Projects:**  
  * Dr. Hadi Salehi (Civil Eng/IfM) secured a $200,000 NSF Engineering Research Initiation (ERI) grant for research on infrastructural IoT monitoring systems using self-powered sensing and **advanced data analytics**, relevant for environmental applications.83  
  * Louisiana Tech is a partner institution in the LSU-led **NSF Regional Innovation Engine: Louisiana Energy Transition Engine** (Award NSF-2315727).123 LaTech's contribution mentioned involves developing low-carbon geopolymers as alternative cement for oil/gas wells, aligning with materials science and energy goals.123  
  * Past NSF funding includes support for the Cyber Corps program via CEnIT.82  
  * While NSF broadly supports AI research and has AI Institutes focused on areas like agriculture 1, no major NSF center or institute grant specifically focused on AI in natural resources and led by or heavily involving LaTech ANS faculty was identified in the reviewed materials.123  
* **U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Funded Projects:**  
  * Drs. Nan Nan and Joshua Adams (Forestry) received a $300,000 USDA Forest Service Wood Innovations Grant to instrument and study the university's new mass timber building, promoting sustainable construction and wood utilization.52 This project involves data collection and analysis related to building performance.  
  * The USDA's Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) includes the **Data Science for Food and Agricultural Systems (DSFAS)** program (A1541), which specifically funds projects integrating data science/AI with agriculture and forestry, including climate-smart approaches.3 This represents a highly relevant potential funding stream.  
* **Other Collaborations:** LaTech engages in various industry partnerships (e.g., CenturyLink, CSRA, Archem LLC, BB\&M LLC) and collaborations with government entities like Barksdale Air Force Base.82

The funded projects demonstrate LaTech's ability to secure federal grants and engage in partnerships in areas related to natural resources (wood products, energy materials) and computational methods (data analytics, IoT). However, based on the available information, large-scale, flagship projects that explicitly merge advanced AI/Data Science techniques with core Forestry, Wildlife, or Environmental Science challenges appear less prominent compared to initiatives in cybersecurity, materials science, or energy. While the capacity and relevant funding opportunities (like USDA DSFAS) exist, catalyzing major interdisciplinary breakthroughs at the AI-Natural Resources nexus may require more focused efforts or be in earlier stages of development not yet reflected in major grant awards documented here.

## **7\. Ethical Considerations and Research Conduct**

The integration of powerful technologies like AI into research necessitates careful consideration of ethical implications and adherence to standards of responsible conduct.

### **7.1. AI Ethics Framework**

The responsible development and application of AI requires clear ethical guidelines.

* **Institutional Policy:** Based on the reviewed materials, Louisiana Tech University does not appear to have a specific, publicly accessible, university-wide policy or set of guidelines addressing the ethical use of Artificial Intelligence in research and teaching.122  
* **General Context:** External sources highlight the growing need for such policies in higher education to address issues like academic integrity (use of generative AI like ChatGPT for assignments), data privacy, algorithmic bias, equity, originality, and intellectual property.127 Professional fields like law are also grappling with AI ethics, emphasizing competence, confidentiality, and accuracy.128 International frameworks like the UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of AI offer principles based on human rights, fairness, transparency, accountability, and sustainability.130  
* **Peer/State Activities:** Other institutions and state bodies are beginning to formulate responses. The University of Louisiana at Lafayette (UL Lafayette) is developing sample syllabus statements on AI use and planning a secure AI sandbox.127 The State of Louisiana has announced the creation of a Louisiana Institute for Artificial Intelligence, which includes policy development as part of its mission.122  
* **Academic Integrity:** LaTech has an established Honor Code regarding academic integrity 134, but its specific interpretation and application regarding the use of AI tools in coursework is not detailed in the available snippets.

The apparent absence of a clearly articulated institutional framework for AI ethics at Louisiana Tech represents a significant gap. Without specific guidance, researchers and students may face ambiguity regarding the responsible use of AI tools, data handling practices (especially concerning bias and privacy beyond standard IRB protocols), transparency in methods, and appropriate attribution or acknowledgment of AI assistance in research outputs and academic work. Developing such guidelines, potentially drawing from established frameworks like UNESCO's and peer institution examples, would provide necessary clarity and promote responsible innovation.

### **7.2. Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) Training**

Ensuring research integrity requires robust training in the responsible conduct of research.

* **Human Subjects Research Training:** Louisiana Tech mandates CITI (Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative) training for all researchers (faculty, staff, students) involved in the collection of or access to data from human subjects. Required courses are either the "Social & Behavioral Research \- Basic/Refresher" or "Biomedical Research \- Basic/Refresher," depending on the research domain. Completion of general RCR CITI courses alone does not fulfill this specific requirement.137  
* **General RCR Principles:** Standard RCR training, as described by CITI and research ethics literature, covers core domains applicable across disciplines, including data acquisition and management, authorship, peer review, mentorship, conflicts of interest, collaborative science, and research misconduct (falsification, fabrication, plagiarism).138 Federal agencies like NSF and NIH mandate RCR training for certain funded personnel.138  
* **LaTech RCR Requirements (Beyond Human Subjects):** Specific RCR training requirements or plans for graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, or faculty at Louisiana Tech *outside* the context of human subjects research were not detailed in the reviewed documents.136 It remains unclear whether a general RCR course (e.g., the CITI RCR Basic course) is required for all graduate students or researchers, particularly those in ANS and COES working with large datasets, computational models, or software development, where ethical issues related to data management, code sharing, reproducibility, and authorship are pertinent.  
* **Oversight:** The university has an Office of Research Compliance, with the Associate Vice President for Research and Dean of the Graduate School serving as a key contact.136

While LaTech has established procedures for RCR training related to human subjects via CITI, the breadth and specificity of RCR training requirements for researchers and students in natural resource and computational fields are not clearly defined in the available materials. Ensuring that RCR training adequately addresses the unique ethical considerations arising in data-intensive research—such as data manipulation, model validation, algorithmic bias, code sharing, and attribution in collaborative computational projects—is crucial for maintaining research integrity in these rapidly evolving fields.

## **8\. Synthesis and Recommendations**

Louisiana Tech University stands at a confluence of established natural resource programs and rapidly developing computational capabilities. The integration of AI, data science, and advanced modeling holds significant promise for enhancing research and education in forestry, wildlife habitat management, environmental science, and GIS at the university.
