These specific documents are framed by overarching principles articulated by the MSU Ethics Institute, emphasizing values like collaboration, equity, excellence, integrity, and respect in the context of AI use.12 These principles cover critical areas such as sourcing and reliability of AI tools, careful data handling, ensuring quality and integrity of AI outputs, understanding publication expectations, promoting equitable and inclusive use, and maintaining awareness of technological developments.13

Key Ethical Considerations Emphasized:  
MSU's guidance highlights several core ethical considerations that align with broader discussions in the field:

* **Data Privacy and Security:** There is a strong emphasis on understanding data classifications (public, confidential, research) and ensuring AI tools meet appropriate security and privacy standards before inputting information. The guidance explicitly warns against using AI tools to process confidential or personal data without proper vetting and underscores the need for stakeholder consent when intellectual property is involved.13 This aligns with concerns around regulations like FERPA and HIPAA mentioned in external contexts.57  
* **Integrity, Accuracy, and Authorship:** Users are held responsible for the accuracy and quality of AI-generated content, necessitating thorough review.13 Understanding and adhering to publisher guidelines regarding AI use in research and appropriate citation practices are also stressed 12, mirroring professional responsibilities highlighted in legal ethics discussions.  
* **Bias, Equity, and Inclusivity:** The guidelines call for users to be critically reflective of potential AI biases and strive to create outputs that are accessible and fair, promoting equity and non-discrimination.13 This reflects widespread concern about biased training data leading to inequitable outcomes.14  
* **Transparency:** In instructional settings, instructors are advised to clearly communicate their use of AI to students.14 The general principle of documenting AI tool usage for accountability is also encouraged 13, echoing calls for transparency in AI systems.57  
* **Human Oversight:** The guidance reinforces that AI should serve as a tool to augment, not replace, human capabilities and judgment, particularly in education where direct instructor engagement remains central.14

Implementation and Enforcement:  
The current guidance is explicitly labeled "interim" and described as a "living document," indicating an adaptive approach to governance in a rapidly changing technological landscape.12 Implementation involves practical steps like vetting AI tools for reliability, security, and ethical alignment, often in consultation with IT professionals.13 At the course level, specific policies may be implemented, such as the prohibition of generative AI tools in FOR 128 to ensure students master foundational coding skills independently.46  
Analysis:  
MSU's establishment of university-wide interim guidance represents a commendable and proactive step towards responsible AI adoption. By addressing research, teaching, and data use through coordinated documents framed by institutional values and ethical principles 12, MSU signals a serious commitment to navigating AI's complexities thoughtfully.  
The specific ethical considerations highlighted—data privacy, integrity, bias, transparency, human oversight—are well-aligned with major themes in national and global AI ethics discussions.14 The practical advice on data classification and tool vetting provides concrete steps for the university community.13

The "interim" nature of the current guidance 12 is understandable given the pace of AI development. However, it also signifies that MSU is in a transitional phase. As AI becomes more deeply integrated, the university will likely need to evolve these guidelines into more permanent, comprehensive policies with clearer enforcement mechanisms and review processes.

The example of FOR 128 prohibiting generative AI 46 illustrates an important pedagogical tension. While the university encourages responsible *use* of AI 13, individual courses or departments must determine how best to integrate these tools without undermining core learning objectives, such as developing independent problem-solving and coding skills. This suggests that alongside university-wide policies, ongoing discussion and tailored approaches at the program and course level will be necessary to effectively balance AI adoption with educational goals.

2. **Develop Scalable AI Infrastructure Roadmap:**  
   * **Action:** Task ICER and relevant IT units with conducting a comprehensive assessment of current HPCC capabilities (compute, storage, networking, GPU availability) against projected 3-5 year AI research and educational demands, particularly for large model training and big data analytics. Develop a phased roadmap for infrastructure expansion, including hardware acquisition, software environment updates, and cloud integration strategies.  
   * **Rationale:** Ensures that infrastructure 10 keeps pace with the rapidly growing computational needs of AI research 8 and education 37, preventing bottlenecks and enabling cutting-edge work.  
   * **Implementation:** Utilize the assessment to inform budget requests, capital planning, and external funding proposals (e.g., NSF Major Research Instrumentation grants).  
3. **Implement University-Wide AI Literacy Program:**  
   * **Action:** Develop and deploy a tiered AI literacy program accessible to all students, faculty, and staff. This could include online modules, workshops, and resources covering AI fundamentals, common tools (building on examples like FOR 128's use of R 46), data literacy, and critical engagement with ethical considerations outlined in MSU's guidance.13  
   * **Rationale:** Moves beyond passive guidance to actively equip the entire campus community with the necessary skills and awareness to navigate an AI-pervaded world responsibly, supporting both academic and operational needs.  
   * **Implementation:** Partner with units like the MSU Libraries 56, the Center for Teaching and Learning Innovation (CTLI), and the Ethics Institute to create and deliver content. Consider incorporating baseline modules into orientations or general education requirements.  
4. **Solidify AI Governance Framework:**  
   * **Action:** Initiate a process to transition from the current "interim" AI guidance documents 12 to formally approved, permanent university policies. These policies should address key areas including AI use in research integrity, academic honesty standards, data security and privacy protocols specific to AI, processes for vetting and procuring AI tools, and clarification of intellectual property rights related to AI-generated content.  
   * **Rationale:** Provides clear, stable, and enforceable standards for the university community, reducing ambiguity and ensuring consistent application of ethical principles as AI use becomes more widespread.  
   * **Implementation:** Convene a task force with representation from research, IT, legal counsel, ethics, faculty senate, and student affairs to draft and review policies, ensuring alignment with MSU 2030 values and evolving best practices.  
5. **Invest in Faculty AI Pedagogy Development:**  
   * **Action:** Create and fund dedicated professional development programs and resources focused on AI in teaching and learning. These should support faculty across all disciplines in understanding AI's potential and limitations, designing effective learning activities that leverage AI appropriately, updating assessment strategies, and addressing ethical considerations within their specific course contexts.14  
   * **Rationale:** Equips instructors with the skills and confidence needed to integrate AI effectively and ethically, addressing pedagogical challenges such as balancing AI tool use with the development of fundamental student skills.46  
   * **Implementation:** Leverage existing structures like CTLI to offer workshops, consultations, learning communities, and grants for innovative AI pedagogy projects. Share best practices and discipline-specific examples.
