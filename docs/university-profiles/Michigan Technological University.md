## **3\. Strategic Vision and AI Integration**

A university's strategic direction provides the framework and impetus for adopting transformative technologies like AI. At MTU, strategic planning at both the university and college levels reflects a strong technological orientation, creating a receptive environment for AI, although explicit, centralized AI initiatives are still emerging.

**University-Level Strategy (Vision 2035 / Tech Forward)**: Michigan Tech's overarching strategic plans, including the Vision 2035 Campus Plan and the Tech Forward initiative, emphasize the institution's role as a premier STEM university preparing students for a future profoundly shaped by technology.1 The planning explicitly acknowledges the context of the "Fourth Industrial Revolution" and the need for the campus to adapt.2 This forward-looking stance is reflected in key priorities such as realigning facilities to match MTU's reputation, putting "tech on display," creating collaborative spaces, and elevating the student experience within a technologically advanced context.2

The university's strategic goals focus broadly on Education, Scholarship, and People.3 Within the "Scholarship" goal, MTU pledges to enhance research, entrepreneurship, and innovation that promote sustainable economic prosperity, health, safety, ethical conduct, and responsible resource use.3 While AI is not explicitly named as a top-level strategic goal in the main plan documents reviewed 3, the "Tech Forward" initiative identifies key focus areas highly relevant to AI, including "Data Revolution and Sensing" and "Autonomous and Intelligent Systems".5 This indicates that AI is viewed as a critical component within broader technological themes rather than a standalone strategic pillar. The plan also highlights the importance of digital connectedness and regional development 6, areas where AI applications could play a significant role. Furthermore, the strategic plan incorporates goals related to sustainability and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) 4, which are crucial considerations for the responsible development and deployment of AI technologies. The university aims to provide an education grounded in sustainability and an understanding of social and cultural contexts 4 and has specific DEI goals related to recruitment and creating an inclusive environment.7 The strategic embrace of technology and data creates a fertile ground for AI integration, but a more targeted, university-wide AI strategy could further focus efforts and investments.

**College-Level Strategic Alignment (CFRES, Computing, Sciences & Arts)**: Individual colleges are actively integrating data science and AI-related concepts into their planning and programs. The College of Forest Resources and Environmental Science (CFRES), aligned with its mission of natural resource sustainability and stewardship 8, has launched a B.S. in Environmental Data Science 9 and is actively recruiting faculty in this area.9 CFRES's strategic plan emphasizes engaging people, leading vibrant programs, and understanding the role of humans in natural systems, including the effects of global change.8 The college also has its own DEI plan focused on understanding the existing climate and improving the sense of belonging.13 This focus on applied data science within the environmental domain aligns well with the university's broader technological direction.

The College of Sciences and Arts (CSA) explicitly incorporates AI into its strategic priorities under the "Human-Technology Frontier" research focus area, which highlights the potential of tools like AI, quantum technology, predictive analytics, and data.14 CSA's strategic plan also emphasizes preparing students for forward-looking careers, providing essential analytical skills, and engaging in cutting-edge interdisciplinary research.14 A key initiative is the creation of online certificate programs for every department by 2025 14, which could readily include AI and data science offerings.

The College of Computing, through its programs in Computer Science, Data Science, Cybersecurity, and Software Engineering 15, serves as the foundational hub for much of the university's AI and data science education and research. Its strategic importance is implicit in the university's overall technological focus and the interdisciplinary nature of the Data Science programs.12

This college-level activity demonstrates a bottom-up integration of AI and data science, driven by disciplinary needs and opportunities. CFRES is leveraging data science for environmental applications, CSA is strategically focusing on the human-technology interface including AI, and the College of Computing provides the core computational expertise.

**Overall Assessment**: MTU's strategic direction is clearly aligned with technological advancement and the data-driven nature of modern research and industry. The "Data Revolution and Sensing" and "Autonomous and Intelligent Systems" focus areas provide strategic grounding for AI initiatives.5 Individual colleges are proactively developing programs and research agendas that incorporate data science and AI. However, the absence of a highly visible, unified, university-wide AI strategy, distinct from broader digital or data initiatives, might lead to fragmented efforts or missed opportunities for synergy. Formalizing such a strategy could help prioritize investments, foster greater interdisciplinary collaboration, and enhance MTU's profile as a leader in specific AI application domains, particularly those related to its strengths in engineering, environment, and natural resources.

## **4\. AI Research Landscape**

Michigan Tech possesses significant research capabilities relevant to AI, anchored by the Michigan Tech Research Institute (MTRI) and complemented by growing expertise within academic departments, particularly in computing and environmental sciences.

* The College of Sciences and Arts has a strategic goal to create online certificate programs for every department 14, potentially increasing offerings relevant to data science applications.

Curriculum Content:  
Analysis of specific program requirements reveals varying levels of integration for AI/ML and advanced computational methods:

* The **Data Science B.S.** core curriculum provides a strong foundation, including courses like Intro to Programming (CS 1121/1131), Data Structures (CS 2321), Database Systems (CS 3425/SAT 3210), Algorithms (CS 4321), Calculus (MA 1160), Linear Algebra (MA 2320/2330), Statistics/Probability (MA 2710, MA 3720), Foundations of Data Science (DATA 2201), Foundations of Machine Learning (DATA 3801), Data Engineering (DATA 3401), and courses covering communication/ethics (DATA 3000\) and a capstone project (DATA 4891).15 Electives allow specialization in ML/AI (e.g., CS 4811, CS 4821, CS 5831, EET 4501).15  
* The **Environmental Data Science B.S.** builds on a similar computational foundation but integrates ecological science and offers specialized tracks.11 The Geospatial track includes remote sensing and spatial statistics; the Environmental Statistics track emphasizes experimental design and predictive modeling using tools like R and Python; the Genomics track includes bioinformatics; and the Global Change track focuses on climate science and modeling.11  
* The **Forestry B.S.** core curriculum includes foundational science (Botany BL 2160, Chemistry CH 1150/1151), math (Calculus MA 1135/1032, Statistics MA 2720), and specialized forestry courses covering ecology (FW 3020), soils (FW 3330), measurements/inventory (FW 2051), silviculture (FW 3010), and management.39 Key quantitative courses are Forest Biometrics (FW 3110\) and Introduction to GIS (FW 3190).56 While providing essential quantitative skills for forestry, the core BSF curriculum does not appear to mandate specific courses in advanced programming (beyond field techniques), data science, or AI/ML.39  
* The **Master of Forestry (MF)** curriculum includes required courses in GIS (FW 5550), Remote Sensing (FW 5540), and Forest Biometrics and Modeling (FW 5201), indicating a focus on advanced spatial analysis and quantitative modeling at the graduate level.50  
* Specific **AI/ML courses** available across departments include Introduction to AI (CS 4811), AI (CS 5811), Advanced Data Mining (CS 5831), Applied Machine Learning (EET 4501), and potentially others under special topics or within specific concentrations.15 Mathematical Sciences offers Predictive Modeling (MA 4790/5790).41

This structure suggests MTU is building dedicated pathways for data science expertise, particularly applied to environmental contexts. Foundational quantitative skills are part of traditional programs like Forestry, but deeper AI/ML engagement likely requires pursuing the dedicated Data Science programs, relevant minors, or specific electives. The online, stackable GIS certificate model provides a flexible pathway for professionals or students in other fields to gain geospatial data skills.51

**Workforce Preparedness**: The curriculum across Data Science and related programs emphasizes practical skills, hands-on experience with real-world datasets, and capstone projects.15 The focus on technical focus areas/minors in the Data Science B.S. aims to prepare graduates for applying data science within specific industries.12 Given the high demand and salaries reported for data scientists 11, these programs are well-positioned to prepare students for emerging careers. The inclusion of communication and ethics components 15 also addresses crucial professional skills. The strong field component in CFRES programs, including the semester-long Integrated Field Practicum (IFP) 34, provides invaluable hands-on experience highly valued by employers in natural resource fields.

## **6\. Computational Infrastructure for AI**

Effective AI research and education depend heavily on robust computational infrastructure, particularly High-Performance Computing (HPC) resources equipped with Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). MTU provides centralized HPC resources, but details on their current capacity for demanding AI workloads are limited in the available information.

HPC Resources:  
Michigan Tech's primary shared HPC resource is the Superior cluster, housed in the Great Lakes Research Center.27 A smaller cluster, Portage, is also available, intended mainly for testing, educational use, and preliminary research.32 The university has invested in expanding Superior's capabilities, completing a two-year expansion project in collaboration with Ingenium Scientific Inc. in early 2025.27  
Information regarding the specific hardware specifications of Superior, especially post-expansion, is somewhat dated in the provided snippets. Earlier descriptions (circa 2014-2018) mention generations of nodes including Intel Sandy Bridge and Xeon E5 processors.33 Storage capacity was noted as 32 TB 64 or 48 TB 33 in older descriptions. The interconnect mentioned is 56 Gb/s InfiniBand.33 While these details provide a baseline, they likely do not reflect the current state after the recent expansion.27 The lack of readily available, up-to-date specifications makes it difficult to fully assess the cluster's current raw computational power (CPU TFLOPS) and its suitability for the most demanding, large-scale AI model training.

GPU Availability and Access:  
Both Superior and Portage clusters include GPU resources.32 Older descriptions specifically mention NVIDIA Tesla M2090 GPUs on Superior (5 nodes, 4 GPUs each) contributing 13-14 TFLOPS.32 It is highly probable that the recent expansion 27 included upgrades to more modern, powerful GPUs suitable for current AI/ML workloads, but specific details (types, quantities, capabilities) are not provided in the available snippets.  
Access to the HPC resources (Superior and Portage) is available to all MTU researchers.64 Access requires submitting a brief proposal, similar to the NSF XSEDE process.64 This suggests a managed allocation system, likely prioritizing projects based on merit or need, although the specific allocation policies or queue structures (especially for GPU resources) are not detailed.

A significant aspect of MTU's HPC access policy is the mandatory training requirement.66 All users must successfully complete **FOSS101: Essentials of Free and Open Source Software** (covering command-line Linux, Git, file management) before an account is created. Subsequently, users must complete **HPC101: Essentials of High-Performance Computing** (covering remote access, data transfer, software compilation via EasyBuild, job submission/monitoring, and serving as the EULA) before running production simulations.66 This structured training ensures a baseline competency among users and adherence to acceptable use policies, but it also introduces a necessary preparatory step before researchers can utilize the HPC resources. Help with hardware/software specification, acquisition, compilation, workflow development, and training is available.64

Software and Environment:  
The user guide mentions the use of EasyBuild for software compilation and the SLURM workload manager (implied by job submission script generation tools like qgenscript mentioned in older timeline entries 67).66 Specific AI/ML libraries or frameworks available on the clusters are not listed, but standard tools like Python and R are likely supported given their use in data science curricula.12  
Adequacy Assessment:  
MTU possesses the necessary foundational HPC infrastructure, including centralized clusters (Superior, Portage) with documented (though potentially outdated) GPU capabilities and a structured access/training process. The recent expansion of Superior 27 indicates a commitment to maintaining and improving these resources. However, based only on the provided information, a definitive assessment of adequacy for current and future AI demands is challenging due to the lack of up-to-date specifications, particularly regarding the type and quantity of available GPUs. The growth of data-intensive programs like Data Science and Environmental Data Science 11 will inevitably increase demand for powerful computational resources. Ensuring that Superior's current capabilities align with these needs and that access mechanisms (especially for GPUs) are efficient and transparent will be crucial for supporting AI research and education effectively. The mandatory training, while beneficial for user competency, could pose a slight barrier to entry compared to more on-demand access models.  
**Table 2: MTU HPC Resources Relevant to AI (Based on Available Data)**

| **Software Mgmt** | EasyBuild mentioned for compilation. | 66 |

*Note: Hardware specifications, particularly for GPUs and post-expansion capabilities, are based on potentially outdated information in the provided snippets.*

## **7\. AI Governance, Ethics, and Responsible Conduct**

As AI tools become more prevalent, establishing clear governance structures, ethical guidelines, and robust training in responsible conduct is paramount. Michigan Tech has taken initial steps by implementing specific policies for generative AI use and maintaining a structured Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) program.

AI-Specific Policies:  
MTU has proactively addressed the rise of generative AI tools by establishing Policy 1.20: Large Language Model Generative Artificial Intelligence Tools in Research Activities.68 This policy provides specific guidance for researchers:

* **Data Sensitivity**: It explicitly prohibits submitting MTU data classified as Tier 1 (confidential or restricted, e.g., PII, proprietary research data) into AI tools unless a contract provides explicit protections AND written consent is obtained from the CIO, CISO, or General Counsel. Only publicly available or non-sensitive data should typically be used.68  
* **Data Ownership/Consent**: Researchers must obtain consent from data owners before sharing any non-public data with AI tools, recognizing that data may be stored or reused by the tool. If the owner cannot be identified, the data cannot be used.68  
* **Output Verification**: Users are responsible for reviewing AI tool output for accuracy, relevance, bias, and potential copyright infringement before use or publication.68  
* **Compliance**: Users must ensure compliance with all applicable laws, university policies, and terms of use associated with both the AI tool and the input data.68

In the academic sphere, the Provost's office provides **syllabus guidance** for faculty.70 This guidance allows instructors flexibility, ranging from prohibiting AI use entirely to permitting its use for assistance (e.g., brainstorming, understanding concepts) provided it is properly attributed. Examples of citation styles (APA, MLA) for AI tools are provided.70 This approach places the onus on instructors to define acceptable use within their specific courses while emphasizing transparency and academic integrity.70

Furthermore, the Department of Humanities is proposing a new **Minor in AI Ethics** for the Essential Education program, designed to introduce students to foundational ethical issues (transparency, bias, fairness, labor impacts, privacy) and the social/cultural dimensions of AI.53 This initiative signals a commitment to integrating AI ethics more formally into the curriculum.

These policies demonstrate MTU's responsiveness to the challenges posed by generative AI, prioritizing data security, intellectual property, academic integrity, and user responsibility.

Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR):  
MTU has a formal RCR training program aligned with guidelines from ORI, NIH, NSF, and USDA NIFA.72 Training is mandatory for various personnel involved in research:

* **Basic RCR**: Required for all degree and certificate-seeking graduate students (except coursework-only master's as of Summer 2024), typically completed during the first semester via an online Canvas course, "Orientation to Graduate Studies and Research".73 Failure to complete results in a registration hold.74  
* **Advanced RCR**: Required for all doctoral students and master's students completing thesis or report options, typically completed in the second or third semester.73 This requirement is fulfilled by taking a pre-approved graduate course or workshop involving significant face-to-face interaction.72 Online-only training (like the CITI Advanced RCR course) is insufficient for on-campus students but may be used by those completing degrees off-campus.72  
* **Other Groups**: Postdoctoral researchers have specific RCR training, new faculty attend an RCR orientation, and undergraduates/staff supported by NSF/NIFA grants must complete CITI Basic/Advanced RCR training respectively.72

The core RCR topics covered are comprehensive and align with federal mandates 72:

* Conflict of interest and commitment  
* Human subjects and animal welfare policies, safe lab practices  
* Mentor/mentee responsibilities and relationships  
* Safe and inclusive research environments (free from harassment/discrimination)  
* Collaborative research (including industry and international)  
* Peer review (confidentiality, security)  
* Data acquisition, analysis, management, sharing, ownership, security, and ethical use  
* Research misconduct (definition and handling)  
* Responsible authorship and publication  
* Societal and environmental impacts of research, contemporary ethical issues

While these topics cover essential aspects of research integrity, including critical areas like data management, security, and ownership which are highly relevant to AI, the provided documentation does not explicitly state whether the *required* RCR training modules or approved advanced courses currently include dedicated content on AI-specific ethical challenges such as algorithmic bias, AI transparency/explainability, or the unique privacy risks associated with large language models beyond general data handling principles.72 The existence of the separate AI research policy 68 and the proposed AI Ethics minor 53 suggests these topics are recognized, but their integration into the mandatory RCR framework may be an ongoing process or an area for future development. Comparatively, other institutions like MSU have held specific RCR events focused on AI.78

**Data Privacy and Security**: The AI research policy 68 strongly reinforces the importance of adhering to MTU's data classification schedule and protecting confidential/restricted data when using AI tools. This links AI governance directly to broader institutional data security practices.

**Academic Integrity**: The guidance on AI use in coursework 70 and general discussions on academic integrity 71 emphasize the need for proper attribution and avoiding plagiarism or unauthorized assistance when using AI tools, aligning AI usage with established academic standards.
