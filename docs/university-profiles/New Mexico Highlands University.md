## **I. Introduction: Defining AI Readiness in Higher Education**

**Context:** Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly emerging as a transformative force with profound implications across society. Its influence extends to reshaping research methodologies, redefining educational necessities, altering workforce demands, and enhancing operational efficiencies within complex organizations. Consequently, higher education institutions face an imperative to strategically engage with AI. This engagement is crucial not only for maintaining institutional relevance and driving innovation but also for adequately preparing students to navigate and contribute to an AI-influenced future.

**Defining AI Readiness:** For a university such as New Mexico Highlands University (NMHU), achieving AI readiness transcends the mere acquisition of technological tools. It demands a comprehensive, holistic assessment of institutional capacity across several critical, interconnected dimensions. These dimensions collectively determine an institution's preparedness to adopt, integrate, and leverage AI effectively and responsibly:

* **Strategic Vision:** The explicit incorporation of AI, data science, and related digital transformation goals into institutional strategic planning documents at the university, college, and departmental levels is a fundamental indicator of readiness.  
* **Research Ecosystem:** The presence and strength of faculty expertise, dedicated research centers or institutes, ongoing AI-related projects, and success in securing funding for AI and computational research are vital components.  
* **Educational Offerings:** The availability and structure of curricula, including degree programs, minors, certificates, and individual courses designed to cultivate both general AI literacy and specialized AI-related skills, are central to educational readiness.  
* **Technology Infrastructure:** Adequate access to, and supportive policies for, High-Performance Computing (HPC) resources, Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), robust data storage solutions, high-speed networking, and relevant software platforms are essential prerequisites for AI research and education.  
* **Policy & Governance:** The existence of clear, comprehensive, and accessible institutional policies and guidelines addressing the ethical use of AI, data privacy and security, intellectual property rights, and the integration of AI into Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) frameworks is crucial for navigating the complexities of AI adoption.  
* **People & Culture:** The readiness equation includes the availability of faculty with relevant expertise, skilled staff support, the development of AI-related competencies among students, and fostering an institutional culture that encourages innovation while upholding rigorous ethical standards and promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion.

**Purpose for NMHU:** This AI Readiness Profile is intended to provide the leadership of New Mexico Highlands University with a structured framework for assessing its current capabilities and preparedness concerning artificial intelligence. By examining strengths, identifying potential weaknesses, and highlighting opportunities across the dimensions outlined above, this document aims to serve as a foundational resource. It is designed to inform strategic decision-making regarding the potential development and implementation of NMHU's "next program" involving AI, ensuring such initiatives are well-grounded, achievable, and aligned with institutional goals and values.

**Methodology Note:** It is important to reiterate that the research materials informing this profile primarily describe the activities, policies, and infrastructure of other institutions, including Michigan State University (MSU), Michigan Technological University (Michigan Tech), Iowa State University (ISU), Louisiana Tech University (LaTech), and Mississippi State University (MSState). Direct data specific to NMHU was not provided. Therefore, this profile utilizes the experiences and structures of these benchmark institutions not to make definitive claims about NMHU's current state, but rather to construct a comprehensive framework for assessment. The examples drawn from these institutions illustrate best practices, common challenges, and key considerations relevant to evaluating AI readiness within a university setting. The profile outlines *what* NMHU needs to evaluate and *what* a state of readiness entails across various domains.

## **II. Strategic Alignment and Institutional Vision for AI**

A fundamental component of AI readiness is the degree to which AI initiatives align with and are integrated into the university's overarching strategic direction. Evaluating NMHU's existing strategic plans—at the university-wide, college, and departmental levels—is a critical first step. This evaluation should seek explicit or implicit references to artificial intelligence, data science, digital transformation, technological innovation, computational research, or related concepts that indicate institutional priority and direction.

Institutions demonstrating higher levels of AI readiness often feature AI explicitly within their strategic frameworks. For instance, Michigan State University's (MSU) 2030 strategic plan directly addresses leveraging AI and data science to tackle challenges like the future of work, misinformation, and global issues. MSU aims for leadership in transdisciplinary solutions and has set ambitious goals, such as reaching $1 billion in annual research expenditures, partly fueled by these technological advancements. MSU further solidified this commitment by planning an "Engineering and Digital Innovation Center" focused on AI, data science, semiconductors, and quantum computing. Similarly, Iowa State University's strategic plan emphasizes becoming a "most student-centric leading research university" and fostering innovation, creating a context where AI can be a key enabler. Michigan Technological University's plan highlights interdisciplinary approaches and advancing sustainable economic prosperity, health, and ethical conduct—areas ripe for AI application. Louisiana has launched "Louisiana Innovation (LA.IO)" with a specific focus on growing technology-enabled startups, including the creation of a $50 million growth fund and a Louisiana Institute for Artificial Intelligence dedicated to applied R\&D, commercialization, and workforce development. Even older plans, like Louisiana Tech's "Tech 2020," aimed to significantly increase research productivity, a goal often pursued today through computational and data-intensive methods. State-level initiatives, such as the Mississippi AI Business Accelerator involving Alcorn State and Jackson State, further underscore the regional economic development potential seen in AI.

The explicit inclusion of AI in strategic planning serves several crucial functions. It signals clear, top-level institutional commitment, which is essential for prioritizing resource allocation—including funding, infrastructure development, and personnel recruitment—needed to support AI initiatives. This commitment helps overcome potential cultural or organizational inertia. Furthermore, a defined strategy provides necessary direction, enabling coordinated efforts across research, education, and policy domains, preventing fragmented or redundant activities. The absence of explicit AI goals within NMHU's current strategic documents would, therefore, suggest a lower level of strategic readiness compared to these benchmarks. It would indicate a potential need to revise existing plans or develop a distinct AI-focused strategy to ensure institutional alignment and focused progress.

However, while ambitious goals are important signals, strategic readiness also demands a realistic alignment between aspiration and capacity. MSU's $1 billion research expenditure target reflects the high aspirations of a major R1 institution, but achieving such goals necessitates substantial resources: expert faculty, state-of-the-art infrastructure, and significant funding streams. Smaller institutions, or those relatively new to intensive AI research, may not possess the internal capacity of established research universities like MSU or Michigan Tech. The example of Louisiana's $50 million state-backed growth fund illustrates the potential necessity of securing external partnerships and substantial funding to realize ambitious AI objectives.

Consequently, any AI strategy developed by NMHU must be firmly grounded in a pragmatic assessment of its current resources—faculty expertise, computational infrastructure, existing funding levels, and potential external support. The strategy should clearly identify the necessary steps to bridge any identified gaps between its AI ambitions and its current capacity. These steps might include targeted faculty hiring in AI-related fields, focused grant applications, planned investments in computational infrastructure, or the cultivation of strategic partnerships with industry, government agencies, or other academic institutions. Pursuing an AI strategy without adequately addressing the resource requirements could lead to unsustainable initiatives and inefficient use of limited funds.

**Recommendation Area:** NMHU should undertake a thorough strategic review to pinpoint how AI initiatives can best align with and advance its core institutional mission and existing priorities (e.g., student success, regional service, specific academic strengths). Consideration should be given to developing a dedicated AI strategic initiative or explicitly embedding AI-related goals—covering research, education, workforce preparation, and operational enhancement—into the next iteration of the university-wide strategic plan. This process must involve careful alignment with available or realistically projected resources and actively explore potential external partnerships to augment internal capacity.

## **III. AI Research Capacity and Ecosystem**

A university's readiness for significant AI programs is intrinsically linked to its existing research capacity and the supporting ecosystem. NMHU must evaluate its current research landscape to identify strengths, gaps, and opportunities related to AI.

**Faculty Expertise and Research Areas:** The first step involves identifying faculty across all colleges and departments whose research currently utilizes or could potentially benefit from AI, machine learning (ML), data science, data mining, advanced computational modeling, simulation, or the analysis of large datasets. This assessment should look beyond explicit "AI" labels, as relevant expertise might reside in fields applying sophisticated computational or statistical methods to domain-specific problems. Departments such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Statistics, Engineering, Business, Natural Sciences (e.g., Biology, Environmental Science), and Social Sciences are common areas where such expertise might be found.

Benchmark institutions often showcase their AI research strengths through dedicated centers and institutes. Examples include Iowa State's AI Institute for Resilient Agriculture (AIIRA) and Translational AI Center (TrAC); Michigan State's AgBioResearch, Institute for Cyber-Enabled Research (ICER), and National Strategic Planning & Analysis Research Center (NSPARC); Michigan Tech's Research Institute (MTRI) focusing on sensing and information technology; and Louisiana Tech's centers focused on Cyber and Information Systems, Micromanufacturing, and Biomedical Engineering. These centers often host specific, high-impact projects, such as AI applications in sustainable agriculture, veterinary medicine, lumber grading, plant breeding, remote sensing, or cybersecurity. NMHU should conduct an internal inventory—perhaps through surveys or departmental reviews—to map existing faculty research interests and identify nascent or established research groups that could form the nucleus of future AI-related research activities.

**Funding and Grant Activity:** A robust AI research program typically requires significant external funding. NMHU needs to assess its current grant portfolio and overall research expenditures, specifically looking for awards related to AI, data science, or computationally intensive projects. Benchmark institutions actively pursue and manage funding from diverse sources, including federal agencies like the National Science Foundation (NSF), National Institutes of Health (NIH), U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Department of Defense (DoD), and Department of Energy (DOE). They also leverage state funding, industry partnerships, and internal mechanisms like seed funding. Institutions like MSU systematically track research expenditures as a key performance indicator. NMHU should analyze its existing funding streams and identify targeted opportunities for securing grants that align with its research strengths and potential AI applications.

**The Importance of Interdisciplinarity:** A recurring theme in successful AI research initiatives is their interdisciplinary nature. AI functions as an enabling technology, and its true value is often unlocked when applied to specific domain challenges, whether in agriculture, healthcare, environmental science, or national security. Major funding bodies increasingly favor transdisciplinary proposals that address complex societal problems. Institutions like MSU explicitly aim to foster such work. Therefore, NMHU's AI research readiness will be substantially enhanced by actively promoting and supporting collaborations between potential AI/computational experts and domain experts in other disciplines relevant to NMHU's mission and regional context. Isolated AI research efforts are likely to have diminished impact and face greater challenges in securing external funding.

**Role of Research Centers:** Establishing dedicated research centers or institutes can serve as a powerful catalyst for AI research growth, enhancing visibility, attracting funding, and facilitating collaboration. However, creating and sustaining these centers represents a significant, long-term investment. The NSF AI Institutes program, for example, involves funding of approximately $20 million over five years per institute. While establishing a formal AI center could be a long-term aspiration for NMHU, a more pragmatic initial step towards readiness might involve nurturing interdisciplinary research clusters focused on existing institutional strengths. This could be supported through internal seed funding mechanisms and prioritizing collaborative grant applications. This phased approach allows for capacity building before committing to the substantial investment required for a dedicated center.

**Recommendation Area:** NMHU should identify and actively support faculty clusters demonstrating potential for AI-related research. This support could take the form of internal seed grants, release time for proposal development, or resources for interdisciplinary workshops. Encouraging and facilitating participation in collaborative, transdisciplinary grant proposals should be a priority. Consideration could be given to establishing a virtual or lightly structured "AI Initiative" to coordinate research efforts and build momentum before potentially investing in a physical research center.

## **IV. Educational Programs and Curriculum Readiness**

An institution's capacity to offer educational programs that equip students with AI literacy and specialized skills is a cornerstone of AI readiness. NMHU must analyze its current curriculum to identify existing strengths and potential gaps.

**Course Inventory and Analysis:** A thorough review of course offerings across relevant departments—including Computer Science, Mathematics, Statistics, Engineering disciplines, Business, and potentially others like Environmental Science, Biology, or Social Sciences—is necessary. This inventory should identify courses covering key foundational and applied areas relevant to AI and data science:

* **Programming Fundamentals:** Especially proficiency in languages commonly used in data science, such as Python and R.  
* **Statistics and Probability:** Foundational understanding of statistical concepts, methods, and probability theory.  
* **Data Structures and Algorithms:** Essential computer science principles for efficient data handling and computation.  
* **Database Management:** Skills for organizing, storing, and querying data.  
* **Machine Learning (ML) / Artificial Intelligence (AI):** Core concepts, algorithms (e.g., regression, classification, clustering, neural networks), and applications.  
* **Data Mining / Data Analytics:** Techniques for discovering patterns and insights from data.  
* **Data Visualization:** Methods for effectively communicating data insights visually.  
* **Geographic Information Systems (GIS) / Remote Sensing / Spatial Analysis:** Relevant for applying AI to environmental, geographical, or resource management problems.  
* **Ethics / Responsible AI:** Courses addressing the societal implications, biases, privacy concerns, and ethical frameworks surrounding AI.

Benchmark institutions offer a diverse portfolio of AI and data science education. This includes dedicated Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degrees in Data Science or Artificial Intelligence, which provide comprehensive, in-depth training. Many also offer minors in Data Science or AI, allowing students from other majors to gain foundational knowledge. Certificates, at both undergraduate and graduate levels, offer focused skill development in specific areas like GIS or Business Analytics. Furthermore, specialized concentrations are often integrated into existing majors, such as Forestry, Business, Engineering, or Environmental Data Science. Curricula frequently incorporate widely used programming languages like Python and R, core ML techniques, data mining, predictive modeling, database management, and crucially, considerations of AI ethics. Some institutions supplement formal coursework with intensive bootcamps or specialized training modules. NMHU should map its current course offerings against these benchmark areas to identify existing strengths and critical gaps, particularly in foundational programming, statistics, and advanced AI/ML topics. Assessing student demand and faculty capacity for developing and delivering new AI-related courses is also crucial.

**Faculty Development:** Integrating AI into the curriculum effectively requires faculty who are comfortable with the technology and its pedagogical implications. NMHU must assess the needs and provide resources for faculty development in this area. Benchmark universities offer support through workshops, teaching guides, and consultations facilitated by centers for teaching and learning or dedicated ethics institutes. MSU, for example, provides specific guidance for instructors on syllabus policies regarding AI use and leverages its Ethics Institute and Center for Teaching and Learning Innovation. Iowa State has also hosted workshops focusing on AI tools and ethics for library staff and the broader campus community. NMHU should survey its faculty to understand their current practices, training needs, and concerns regarding AI in education and assess the capacity of its existing faculty development structures to provide adequate support.

**Foundational Skills are Prerequisite:** The success of any AI or data science educational program hinges on students possessing strong foundational skills in quantitative and computational areas. Analysis of benchmark programs reveals a consistent emphasis on prerequisites or core requirements in programming, statistics, and mathematics, particularly linear algebra and calculus. This is because AI and machine learning algorithms are fundamentally mathematical and statistical constructs, their implementation requires programming proficiency, and effective data handling relies on understanding database principles and data structures. Therefore, NMHU's educational readiness for AI depends critically on the strength and accessibility of these foundational courses. Enhancing or ensuring broad access to high-quality introductory programming, statistics, and relevant mathematics courses may be a necessary precursor to launching more specialized AI programs.

**AI Literacy as a General Education Imperative:** Beyond specialized degrees or minors, there is a growing consensus that a basic level of AI literacy is becoming essential for all university graduates. This includes understanding the fundamental capabilities and limitations of AI tools, as well as appreciating the significant ethical considerations involved, such as bias, privacy, and the potential for misinformation. AI is poised to impact nearly every field and facet of daily life. Responsible citizenship and professional practice in the coming decades will require individuals to critically engage with AI technologies. Universities like Iowa State are recognizing this by integrating AI literacy across various disciplines. NMHU's AI readiness assessment should thus extend beyond specialized program development to consider strategies for incorporating AI literacy into the general education curriculum. This could involve creating broadly accessible introductory courses, workshops, or modules, perhaps leveraging existing university resources or adapting guidance materials developed by other institutions, such as MSU's AI guidance for students.

**Recommendation Area:** NMHU should prioritize the development and accessibility of foundational courses in programming (Python/R), statistics, and linear algebra. As initial steps into specialized AI education, exploring the creation of an AI Minor or a Data Science Certificate could be viable. Concurrently, implementing faculty development workshops focused on AI tools and ethical pedagogy is essential. Consideration should also be given to an "AI Across the Curriculum" initiative to promote broader AI literacy among all students.

## **V. Technology Infrastructure for AI**

The successful implementation of AI programs, whether in research or education, is heavily reliant on robust and accessible technology infrastructure. NMHU's readiness assessment must include a critical evaluation of its computational resources, data management capabilities, and software availability.

**High-Performance Computing (HPC) Resources:** Many AI applications, particularly those involving large datasets or complex model training (like deep learning), demand computational power exceeding that of standard desktop computers. Therefore, access to HPC resources is a key enabler for AI readiness. NMHU should evaluate:

* **Availability and Specifications:** Does NMHU currently operate or provide access to an HPC cluster? If so, what are its technical specifications? Key metrics include the total number of processing cores, the type and speed of processors (e.g., Intel Xeon, AMD EPYC), the total amount and type of RAM, and the type and speed of the interconnect network (e.g., InfiniBand, Ethernet).  
  * *Benchmark Examples:* MSU's ICER operates a supercomputer with over 56,000 cores, GPUs, 8 PB storage, and 3.9 petaflops capacity. Michigan Tech's Superior cluster features CPU nodes (Intel Sandy Bridge/Xeon E5) and GPU nodes (NVIDIA Tesla M2090/K80) connected via InfiniBand. Iowa State's Nova cluster includes Intel Skylake and AMD EPYC processors, substantial RAM (up to 3TB on some nodes), and significant local NVME storage. Louisiana Tech leverages the LONI network's Queen Bee 2 and its local Cerberus cluster. Mississippi State manages large clusters like Orion (72,000+ cores, 5.0+ petaflops) and Hercules (40,000+ cores, 3.0 petaflops).  
* **GPU Access:** Deep learning and other computationally intensive AI tasks are often significantly accelerated by GPUs. Does NMHU's infrastructure include GPU-accelerated nodes? What types of GPUs are available (e.g., NVIDIA Tesla, A100, V100)?.  
  * *Benchmark Examples:* Michigan Tech's Superior and Portage clusters include nodes with NVIDIA Tesla M2090 and K80 GPUs. Iowa State's Nova features nodes with NVIDIA Tesla V100 and A100 GPUs. LSU's SuperMIC includes nodes with NVIDIA Tesla K20X and V100 GPUs. MSU's HPCC also provides GPU resources.  
* **Access Policies and Support:** How do faculty and students gain access to these resources? Is there a cost associated (e.g., free allocation tiers, buy-in models, grant-funded access)? Are policies clear and equitable?. What level of user support, training, and consultation is available?. Is there a user-friendly interface like Open OnDemand?.  
  * *Benchmark Examples:* MSU provides free baseline access with buy-in options for substantial needs, extensive user support via ICER, and web portal access. Michigan Tech requires completion of online training modules (FOSS101, HPC101) as a prerequisite for access. Iowa State uses Open OnDemand for web access and requires users to be on the campus network or VPN. LONI access for students requires faculty sponsorship and association with a resource allocation. Mississippi State also offers Open OnDemand portals for its clusters.

NMHU needs to inventory its current computational capabilities, compare them against these benchmarks, and survey its potential user base (faculty and students) to understand current usage patterns and identify unmet needs or barriers to access.

**Data Infrastructure:** AI is fundamentally data-driven. Readiness requires infrastructure capable of handling potentially large and complex datasets.

* **Network Capacity:** Is the campus network robust enough to handle the transfer and processing of large datasets required for AI research and teaching?  
* **Data Storage:** Are there adequate, secure, and accessible data storage solutions? This includes evaluating total capacity, performance (e.g., speed of access), backup and recovery procedures, and security protocols.  
  * *Benchmark Examples:* Major HPC centers provide petabyte-scale storage (MSU: 8 PB; Iowa State: multiple file servers with hundreds of TB each; MSU/NOAA: 9 PB \+ 18 PB scratch; LSU: 840 TB Lustre; TTU: 6.9 PB DDN storage). Local node storage (often fast NVME SSDs) is also common.  
* **Data Management Policies:** Are there clear policies regarding data ownership, sharing, privacy, and security, particularly for sensitive data types often encountered in research (discussed further in Section VI)?.

NMHU should assess its network infrastructure and data storage solutions relative to the anticipated demands of AI initiatives.

**Specialized Labs and Software:** Beyond core HPC, AI readiness can be enhanced by specialized facilities and software.

* **Labs:** Does NMHU have accessible labs equipped for specific AI-related applications like GIS/remote sensing, robotics, or advanced visualization?  
  * *Benchmark Examples:* Michigan Tech's MTRI Spatial Analysis Lab (SAL) provides a suite of GIS and remote sensing software. MSU has GIS labs, microscopy centers, and facilities supporting environmental or biological research that might leverage AI.  
* **Software:** Is essential software for AI/ML and data science readily available and supported? This includes programming environments (Python, R with relevant libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch), statistical packages, GIS platforms (ArcGIS, QGIS), and potentially specialized tools for image analysis (ERDAS, ENVI) or other domains.  
  * *Benchmark Examples:* Iowa State provides access to tools like Adobe Firefly (image generation), Microsoft Copilot, and Github Copilot. Michigan Tech's SAL has ESRI, open-source GIS, ERDAS, ENVI, eCognition, Agisoft Metashape, Pix4D. HPC centers typically provide access to a wide range of scientific software, compilers, and libraries.

NMHU should inventory its specialized lab facilities and software licenses, comparing availability and support against the needs identified by potential AI programs and research clusters.

**Impact of Access Policies:** The policies governing access to HPC and other computational resources significantly influence an institution's practical AI readiness. Restrictive or costly access can stifle innovation and create inequities, particularly for students or researchers new to computational methods or lacking substantial grant funding. How resources are allocated—whether through free baseline tiers, departmental quotas, individual buy-ins, or solely via grant funding—directly impacts who can participate in AI research and education. Institutions aiming for broad AI integration often adopt models that provide some level of free access to lower barriers to entry, as seen at MSU, Michigan Tech, and Iowa State. Therefore, NMHU's assessment must critically examine its access policies to ensure they promote, rather than hinder, equitable utilization of computational resources for both research and educational purposes. Consideration should be given to models that support initial exploration and learning without immediate cost barriers.

**Beyond Compute: Data and Software Infrastructure:** While HPC and GPU capabilities are often the focus, a holistic view of infrastructure readiness must include data management and software. AI is data-hungry, and inadequate storage, slow data transfer, or lack of access to essential software libraries (e.g., for GIS, machine learning, visualization) can create significant bottlenecks, limiting the effectiveness of even powerful computing hardware. NMHU's infrastructure assessment must encompass these critical supporting elements.

**Recommendation Area:** NMHU should conduct a comprehensive audit of its HPC resources (including GPU availability), data storage systems, network capacity, and relevant software licenses. Compare current capacity and access policies against benchmark institutions and survey users to identify needs and bottlenecks. Develop a multi-year infrastructure plan that addresses identified gaps and supports the anticipated requirements of the proposed AI program, considering tiered or subsidized access models to promote equity.

## **VI. Policy, Governance, and Ethical Considerations**

Integrating AI into university operations, research, and teaching necessitates a robust framework of policies and governance structures to ensure responsible and ethical use. AI technologies introduce unique challenges related to data privacy, security, bias, intellectual property, academic integrity, and research conduct that existing policies may not fully address.

**AI-Specific Policies and Guidelines:** NMHU needs to assess whether its current policies adequately cover the use of AI tools, particularly generative AI.

* **Existence of AI Guidelines:** Does NMHU have university-wide or departmental guidelines specifically addressing the use of AI in research, teaching, and administrative tasks?  
  * *Benchmark Examples:* MSU has issued interim guidance on generative AI for research/creative activities and data use/risks, often facilitated by its Ethics Institute. Michigan Tech has a specific policy for Large Language Model Generative AI Tools in Research Activities and general AI use considerations. Iowa State provides guidance through its IT services and Office of the VP for Research, along with ethics resources. Mississippi State offers Generative AI Guidelines and blocks certain third-party services for security. Louisiana has released state-level guidance for AI in K-12, and universities often adopt broader ethical use policies for software and data. The University of Virginia provides links to standards from NSF, NAS, and the European Commission.  
* **Key Policy Areas:** Effective AI guidelines typically address several critical areas:  
  * **Data Privacy and Security:** Strict rules on inputting confidential, restricted, or sensitive data (e.g., PII, FERPA, HIPAA, research subject data, proprietary information, unpublished findings) into AI tools, especially public-facing generative AI. Emphasis on understanding data classification and the data handling practices of third-party AI tools. Requirement for security reviews and contracts for tools handling sensitive data.  
  * **Intellectual Property (IP) and Copyright:** Warnings against inputting proprietary IP without consent and caution regarding the IP status of AI-generated output. Adherence to existing software copyright policies.  
  * **Accuracy, Bias, and Misinformation:** User responsibility for verifying the accuracy of AI outputs and being aware of potential biases embedded in training data or algorithms. Concerns about AI "hallucinations" or fabricated information.  
  * **Academic Integrity:** Clear guidelines for students on permissible use of AI tools in coursework, emphasizing the need for proper attribution and citation when use is allowed, and prohibiting unauthorized use (plagiarism). Policies often allow instructors to set course-specific rules.  
  * **Research Integrity (RCR):** Addressing AI use in the context of research misconduct (fabrication, falsification, plagiarism), authorship, peer review (often prohibiting use of generative AI due to confidentiality concerns), data acquisition and management, and conflicts of interest.  
  * **Transparency and Accountability:** Emphasizing human responsibility for AI outputs and the need for transparency in AI use. Documenting AI tool usage.  
  * **Ethical Principles:** Aligning AI use with institutional values like fairness, equity, inclusivity, and respect.  
* **NMHU Action:** Review existing policies (e.g., Acceptable Use, Data Security, Academic Integrity, RCR, Intellectual Property) to identify overlaps and gaps concerning AI. Develop or adapt comprehensive AI usage guidelines covering the areas listed above, ensuring they are clearly communicated to students, faculty, and staff. Consider establishing a task force or leveraging existing governance structures (like an IT governance committee or research integrity office) to oversee AI policy development and updates.

**Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) Integration:** AI introduces new dimensions to RCR. Training programs must be updated to address these.

* **Assessment Area:** Does NMHU's current RCR training program (for undergraduate researchers, graduate students, postdocs, faculty) explicitly cover ethical issues related to AI?  
  * *Benchmark Examples:* RCR programs at institutions like Michigan Tech and MSU cover core topics mandated by funding agencies (NIH, NSF, NIFA) such as research misconduct, data management, authorship, peer review, mentor/mentee responsibilities, conflicts of interest, and collaborative research. Increasingly, institutions are incorporating AI ethics into RCR training or offering specialized workshops (e.g., MSU's "Promises and Pitfalls of AI for Research and Scholarship Integrity", Mississippi State's RCR training on "Ethical Implications of Using AI in Research", University of Michigan's DAIR3 program focusing on RCR in biomedical data science and AI). Training often involves online modules (e.g., CITI Program) and mandatory discussion-based or face-to-face components.  
* **Key AI-Related RCR Topics:**  
  * Data integrity, security, privacy, and ownership in the context of AI data collection and analysis.  
  * Algorithmic bias and fairness in research design and interpretation.  
  * Responsible authorship and publication practices when AI tools are used (disclosure, citation).  
  * Confidentiality in peer review and the prohibition of using generative AI with submitted manuscripts/proposals.  
  * Research misconduct (fabrication, falsification, plagiarism) involving AI-generated data or text.  
  * Ethical considerations in human subjects research involving AI, including informed consent.  
* **NMHU Action:** Review and update existing RCR training materials and delivery methods to explicitly incorporate ethical considerations specific to AI in research. Ensure training addresses data handling, bias, authorship, peer review, and misconduct related to AI tools. Leverage resources from funding agencies (NIH, NSF, USDA) and potentially external training platforms like CITI if not already in use. Ensure training meets requirements of relevant funding agencies.

**Governance Structures:** Effective oversight is needed to manage AI implementation and address emerging issues.

* **Assessment Area:** Does NMHU have a designated body (e.g., AI task force, IT governance committee, ethics committee) responsible for overseeing AI strategy, policy, and ethical review?  
  * *Benchmark Examples:* MSU utilizes its Ethics Institute and cross-functional working groups. Iowa State has an AI Committee with subcommittees for Policy, Teaching & Learning, Research, Communications, and Operational Efficiencies. Michigan Tech's Research Integrity office and Provost's office are involved in AI policy. Louisiana Tech's Computing Center is responsible for software use policies.  
* **NMHU Action:** Identify or establish a clear governance structure responsible for AI oversight. This body should have representation from IT, research administration, academic affairs, legal counsel, and faculty/student stakeholders. Ensure mechanisms exist for ongoing monitoring, review, and updating of AI policies and practices as the technology evolves.

The development of sound policies and governance is not merely a compliance exercise; it is essential for building trust, mitigating risks, and ensuring that AI is deployed in a manner consistent with NMHU's values and mission. Proactive engagement with ethical considerations from the outset, as emphasized by institutions like MSU and Iowa State, provides a resilient framework for navigating the rapidly changing AI landscape. Failure to establish clear guidelines can lead to inconsistent practices, potential misuse of technology, data breaches, ethical violations, and damage to the institution's reputation.

**Recommendation Area:** NMHU should prioritize the development and dissemination of clear, comprehensive AI usage policies covering data privacy, security, IP, academic integrity, and research ethics. Integrate AI-specific modules into mandatory RCR training for all researchers and relevant students. Establish or designate a cross-functional committee to oversee AI governance, policy updates, and ethical review processes.

## **VII. People, Culture, and Collaboration**

Ultimately, AI readiness depends on people—their skills, awareness, and willingness to engage with the technology responsibly—and an institutional culture that supports both innovation and ethical practice.

**Faculty Expertise and Development:** As discussed in the Research and Education sections, identifying existing faculty expertise in AI, data science, and related computational fields is crucial. Equally important is providing ongoing professional development opportunities for *all* faculty to understand how AI can be used (and misused) in their disciplines and in their teaching.

* **Assessment Area:** What mechanisms exist at NMHU for faculty training on AI tools, AI ethics, and AI-integrated pedagogy? Are there incentives or support for faculty to develop AI-related courses or research projects?  
  * *Benchmark Examples:* MSU offers faculty resources through its Ethics Institute, CTLI, and specific guidance documents. Iowa State provides workshops and has an Ethics Hub. Michigan Tech provides teaching resources and policy guidance through the Provost's office. Universities may use strategic hiring initiatives (like MSU's Global Impact Initiative) or internal seed funding to build faculty capacity.  
* **NMHU Action:** Assess current faculty development offerings and identify needs related to AI. Consider partnerships with organizations like Climate Change AI or leveraging resources from professional societies or consortia to provide training. Explore internal funding mechanisms to incentivize AI curriculum development or research initiation.

**Staff Support and Expertise:** Implementing and supporting AI initiatives requires skilled technical and administrative staff.

* **Assessment Area:** Does NMHU have sufficient IT staff with expertise in HPC management, data security, network administration, and potentially AI/ML software support? Is there adequate support staff in research administration (e.g., grant writing support for AI projects, RCR administration) and instructional design to assist faculty?  
  * *Benchmark Examples:* HPC centers rely on dedicated staff for system administration, user support, and consulting. Research Integrity offices manage RCR training and compliance. Offices of Research Support assist with grant proposals. Centers for Teaching and Learning provide pedagogical support.  
* **NMHU Action:** Evaluate current staffing levels and expertise in IT, research support, and faculty development units relative to the potential demands of AI initiatives. Identify potential training needs or areas requiring new hires.

**Student Skills and AI Literacy:** Preparing students for an AI-driven future is a core responsibility.

* **Assessment Area:** Beyond formal coursework (Section IV), what opportunities exist for students to develop AI/data science skills (e.g., workshops, bootcamps, research experiences, student clubs)? How is general AI literacy being fostered across the student body?  
  * *Benchmark Examples:* Institutions offer workshops, REU (Research Experiences for Undergraduates) programs, capstone projects, student organizations, and specific guidance for students on ethical AI use. MSU has an AI Club for students. Iowa State integrates AI ethics into student activities like Ethics Bowl.  
* **NMHU Action:** Inventory existing co-curricular opportunities related to data science and AI. Assess student interest and identify potential areas for new initiatives (e.g., coding workshops, data science club, AI ethics discussions). Ensure clear communication to students regarding ethical AI use policies.

**Institutional Culture:** A culture that embraces innovation while prioritizing ethical considerations, collaboration, and inclusivity is essential for successful AI adoption.

* **Assessment Area:** Does NMHU's culture encourage experimentation with new technologies? Are there mechanisms for interdisciplinary collaboration? How are ethical discussions promoted? How are diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) integrated into technology planning and implementation?  
  * *Benchmark Examples:* Universities explicitly state values like collaboration, equity, excellence, integrity, and respect in their AI guidance. Strategic plans often include DEI goals. Specific initiatives address DEI in STEM and computing. Ethical considerations are woven into AI discussions and policies. Collaboration is often a stated goal or facilitated through centers and initiatives.  
* **NMHU Action:** Assess the current institutional climate regarding technological innovation and ethical considerations. Promote cross-departmental conversations about AI through seminars or workshops. Ensure DEI principles are explicitly considered in the planning and implementation of any new AI program.

**External Collaboration and Partnerships:** AI readiness can be significantly enhanced through strategic external partnerships.

* **Assessment Area:** Does NMHU have existing partnerships (or potential for partnerships) with industry, government agencies (like Los Alamos National Laboratory), other universities, or community organizations that could support AI initiatives (e.g., providing data, funding, expertise, internship opportunities, research collaboration)?  
  * *Benchmark Examples:* MSU partners with health systems, commodity groups, state agencies, federal agencies (USDA, EPA, Army), and industry (e.g., Google, TechSmith, Chainparency, AWS) on research and workforce development. Michigan Tech collaborates with industry (Leidos), federal agencies (NASA, FAA, USDOT, ARPA-E, USDOE, EPA, NPS, USAID, NSF), and state agencies (MDNR, MDOT) via MTRI and CFRES. Iowa State collaborates with industry (e.g., John Deere), federal agencies (NSF, USDA, DOE), and other universities in consortia like AIIRA. Louisiana leverages state economic development initiatives and partnerships with industry (e.g., BASF, Ochsner) and other universities. Mississippi State collaborates with USDA-ARS, state agencies,
