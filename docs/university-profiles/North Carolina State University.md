However, a potential gap exists in the deeper integration of AI/ML tools and methods *within* the curricula of traditional domain science programs like Forestry, beyond introductory or geospatial applications.22 While specialized tracks exist, ensuring all graduates in fields heavily impacted by AI are equipped with relevant computational skills remains an area for development. The AI Academy stands out as a significant commitment to the university's land-grant mission, directly addressing state workforce needs through industry partnerships.17

## **5\. Enabling Infrastructure**

Effective AI research and education rely on robust computational infrastructure. NC State provides a combination of centralized High-Performance Computing (HPC), specialized resources, and supporting software.

High-Performance Computing (HPC)  
The primary HPC resource at NC State is the Linux cluster currently named Henry2 or Hazel.37 Access to this shared resource is managed by the Office of Information Technology (OIT) HPC Services.

* **Access Policies**: Access is project-based. Faculty members can request one research project at no charge. Separate projects can be requested for instructional use in specific courses. Students or collaborators must be added to a faculty member's project. A special arrangement exists with the University Libraries to provide trial access for undergraduate or non-thesis master's students who are not part of a faculty research group or registered for an HPC-using course.37 Access is also available to researchers at partner universities, including East Carolina University (ECU), UNC Greensboro (UNCG), and UNC Wilmington (UNCW), often requiring sponsorship by an existing PI on the system.37 This tiered access model, while structured, could potentially create hurdles for students needing resources for independent projects or interdisciplinary work not fitting neatly into faculty research or course structures.  
* **Usage Guidelines**: Users access the cluster via Secure Shell (SSH) to designated login nodes or through web portals like Open OnDemand.37 Direct access to compute nodes is prohibited; all computational work must be submitted through the LSF job scheduler. OIT enforces limits on concurrent login sessions and idle time to manage resources. Crucially, running computationally intensive or memory-heavy processes directly on the shared login nodes is forbidden; these nodes are strictly for preparation tasks like editing files, compiling code, and submitting jobs.37 Users are expected to utilize resources efficiently.37  
* **Support**: OIT HPC Services provides documentation, consulting, support, beginner workshops, tutorials (text and video), and user forums to assist researchers and instructors in utilizing the HPC resources effectively.37

Data Science and Storage Resources  
NC State participates in the North Carolina Data Science and Analytics Initiative (NCDSA), a federated platform involving UNC-Chapel Hill and UNC-Charlotte, leveraging shared resources (NCSU-DSR).4 The availability of Open OnDemand provides a user-friendly, web-based interface for accessing HPC resources, managing files, submitting jobs, and even running graphical applications or remote desktop sessions.37 This likely lowers the barrier to entry for researchers who may be less comfortable with traditional command-line cluster interaction. Specific details on storage capacities and file system structures (e.g., /home, /scratch) are mentioned in usage policies but quantitative limits were not detailed in the provided snippets.37  
Specialized Infrastructure  
Recognizing that general-purpose HPC may not suffice for all cutting-edge AI research, NC State has invested in specialized hardware. Notably, the Plant Sciences Initiative houses an NVIDIA Grace Hopper 200 supercomputer specifically for developing AI applications in agriculture.3 This targeted investment highlights an understanding that specific domains may require optimized computational environments. Additionally, research centers like the CGA and various ECE labs maintain their own specialized equipment and computational resources tailored to geospatial analysis, machine learning, and related fields.15  
Software Availability  
The university provides access to a range of software relevant to AI and data science. Common programming languages like Python and R are utilized in DSA courses and the AI Academy.23 Geospatial software, particularly ArcGIS, is central to the MGIST program and CGA activities.14 While a comprehensive list of centrally installed software on the HPC cluster was not provided, support for compiling code is available.37  
Overall, NCSU provides a solid foundation of HPC resources accessible to researchers and educators, complemented by user-friendly interfaces like Open OnDemand and specialized hardware for strategic research areas. The access policies aim for broad availability but involve distinct procedures for different user categories, which may require navigation. The investment in domain-specific hardware like the Grace Hopper system indicates a mature understanding of the diverse computational needs of modern AI research.

NC State University demonstrates a proactive approach to addressing the ethical considerations and governance challenges posed by the rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence. The university has developed and disseminated specific guidelines for various user groups and contexts, emphasizing responsible use, data security, and academic integrity.

Policy Landscape  
Rather than a single monolithic AI policy, NC State has established a suite of guidelines tailored to different activities and communities. These include:

* Guidelines for the use of generative AI tools for **business tasks by staff**, developed by the AI Advisory Group.9  
* Guidance for using AI in **university communications**, emphasizing transparency and accuracy.10  
* Guidance for **teaching and learning**, addressing both instructor use and student expectations.12  
* OIT guidance on **approved tools and data security classifications**.11

This multi-pronged approach allows for context-specific advice. However, it's noted that as of August 2024, an official, overarching university policy specifically governing all AI use might still be under development, with current documents serving as evolving guidance.12 The AI Advisory Group plays a key role in establishing these norms.9

Core Ethical Principles  
Across the various guidelines, several core principles consistently emerge:

* **Human-Centeredness and Accountability**: AI is viewed as an assistive tool to augment, not replace, human judgment and creativity. Humans remain ultimately accountable for decisions and work products, even when AI is used.9  
* **Transparency and Disclosure**: Users are expected to be transparent about their use of AI, particularly for tasks impacting decision-making or with ethical/legal ramifications. Disclosure statements are recommended in such cases.9  
* **Data Privacy and Security**: Protecting sensitive and confidential university data is paramount. Strict prohibitions exist against inputting regulated data (FERPA, HIPAA), proprietary information, or unpublished research into non-approved or public AI tools.9 Use of university accounts and approved tools is mandated for university data.11  
* **Fairness, Inclusivity, and Bias Mitigation**: There is explicit recognition that AI can perpetuate biases present in training data. Users are urged to critically evaluate AI outputs for bias, ensure representativeness, and consider accessibility.9  
* **Accuracy and Verification**: Users are responsible for verifying the factual accuracy of AI-generated content, as AI tools can "hallucinate" or provide incorrect information.10  
* **Intellectual Property and Copyright**: Caution is advised regarding the potential for AI tools to replicate copyrighted material or misuse intellectual property entered into them.10  
* **Continuous Learning**: Users are encouraged to stay informed about AI developments and evolving university guidelines.9

Academic Integrity  
For students, the use of AI tools is governed by instructor-specific policies outlined in course syllabi.12 When permitted, proper citation and transparency regarding the extent of AI use are required.12 Using AI to plagiarize, cheat on assessments, or misrepresent one's own work constitutes academic dishonesty.12 While AI detection tools are available, instructors are cautioned against over-reliance and encouraged to engage in dialogue with students.12  
Teaching and Curriculum  
Instructors are guided to use AI as a complementary tool, maintaining human interaction as central to education.13 They must be transparent with students about their own use of AI in course preparation or delivery and set clear expectations for student use via syllabus statements (options range from open use with attribution to strict prohibition).12 Encouraging critical evaluation of AI outputs and addressing ethical considerations like bias are key pedagogical responsibilities.12  
Research Ethics  
While specific guidelines for AI in research proposals or conduct are not detailed in the provided snippets beyond general data handling rules 9, ethical considerations are integrated into relevant coursework, such as GIS 501 (Geospatial Professionalism), which covers the ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI) of spatial data use.28 General principles of research integrity, data privacy, and intellectual property protection apply.  
***Table 3: NCSU AI Governance Framework Summary***

| Policy/Guideline Area | Key Principles Emphasized | Specific Restrictions/Requirements | Responsible Unit (Implied/Stated) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Staff/Business Use** | Human-centered, Accountability, Transparency, Data Privacy, Fairness, Accuracy, IP Respect | Use approved tools, Adhere to data classification levels, Disclose impactful AI use, Verify outputs, Consult unit leadership | AI Advisory Group, OIT |
| **Communications** | Human-centered, Accountability, Transparency, Accuracy, No Deception, IP Respect | Review/edit all AI content, Verify facts, Avoid generating full content/images/audio, Disclose impactful use, Use approved tools | University Communications |
| **Teaching/Learning** | Human-centric, Transparency, Critical Thinking, Inclusivity, Academic Integrity | Instructor sets policy via syllabus, Cite permitted AI use, Avoid plagiarism/cheating, Verify outputs, Address bias | Provost/OFE, Instructors, DSA |
| **Data Security** | Privacy, Security, Compliance | Prohibit input of sensitive/confidential/regulated data into non-approved tools, Use NC State accounts, Follow data classification | OIT, AI Advisory Group |

NCSU's governance approach appears pragmatic and focused on mitigating immediate risks, particularly concerning data security and academic integrity.9 This allows for controlled exploration and adoption of AI tools. The emphasis on AI as an assistive technology requiring human oversight and critical evaluation establishes a responsible foundation.9 The decentralized approach to syllabus policies offers flexibility to instructors but introduces potential inconsistencies for students navigating different courses.12 While awareness of AI bias and the importance of fairness are stressed 9, the current guidelines focus more on user vigilance than on providing specific technical methods or institutional processes for bias detection and mitigation, suggesting this is an area requiring ongoing development and support.

3. **Optimize Infrastructure Access and Support**:  
   * Review the current HPC access policies 37 to identify and mitigate potential barriers for interdisciplinary student teams, unfunded faculty research, and users needing exploratory or developmental access. Consider simplified pathways or dedicated resource pools for these groups.  
   * Expand targeted user support, training materials, and consulting services specifically designed for researchers and students in disciplines less traditionally reliant on HPC, promoting broader adoption of computational resources.37  
   * Continue to evaluate and invest in scalable cloud computing resources as a flexible complement or alternative to the traditional on-premises HPC cluster, potentially offering easier access for certain types of data science workflows.  
4. **Mature AI Governance Framework**:  
   * Expedite the finalization and adoption of a clear, comprehensive university-wide policy governing the ethical development, deployment, and use of AI technologies, consolidating and building upon the existing guidelines.9  
   * Establish a transparent and accessible process for the ethical review of AI-related research projects and operational deployments, potentially integrating AI-specific expertise into existing structures like the IRB or creating a dedicated AI ethics review board.  
   * Implement mandatory, periodic training modules for all faculty, staff, and students covering AI ethics, data privacy, academic integrity, and university-specific AI policies and guidelines.  
5. **Invest in Continuous Talent Development**:  
   * Ensure sustained funding and support for successful initiatives like the AI Academy 17 and the DSA Postdoctoral Scholars program 1 to maintain momentum in workforce development and educational innovation.  
   * Create dedicated faculty development programs focused on integrating AI into teaching methodologies and research practices across various disciplines, moving beyond basic tool usage to deeper pedagogical and scientific integration.  
   * Offer targeted workshops and resources for university staff focused on leveraging approved AI tools effectively and ethically to enhance operational efficiency and service delivery.9  
6. **Amplify Partnerships and Outreach**:  
   * Proactively utilize the DSA, CGA, AI Academy, and college-based research centers (e.g., CAFS, CIFS) 5 to cultivate strategic partnerships with industry, government agencies, and community organizations for collaborative, translational AI research.  
   * Emphasize NCSU's land-grant mission and unique strengths (e.g., agriculture, environmental science, geospatial analytics) in outreach efforts to attract partners interested in applying AI for public good and economic development in North Carolina.2  
   * Expand opportunities for student internships and capstone projects 14 involving external partners to provide real-world AI application experience.
