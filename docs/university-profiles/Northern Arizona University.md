### **High-Performance Computing (HPC): Monsoon Cluster**

The primary HPC resource at NAU is the Monsoon cluster, managed by the Advanced Research Computing (ARC) group.27

* **Hardware Configuration:** Monsoon is a Linux-based cluster (RHEL 8\) featuring 107 nodes, 4048 CPU cores, and 26TB of total memory.14 It boasts a measured peak CPU performance of 224 teraflops.14 Crucially for AI/ML workloads, the cluster includes 27 NVIDIA GPUs, offering a mix of K80 (12GB VRAM), P100 (16GB VRAM), V100 (16GB VRAM), and A100 (40GB VRAM) models.13 The A100 GPUs are specifically recommended for deep learning tasks.13 Nodes are interconnected via FDR and HDR InfiniBand.14  
* **Storage:** Monsoon provides a tiered storage system: /home directories (10GB quota per user) are backed up and snapshotted for scripts and small files; /scratch offers 450TB of shared Lustre storage for temporary/intermediate files with a 30-day retention policy; and /project provides 500TB of ZFS-based long-term storage, with 5TB allocated free per faculty member and options to purchase more.14  
* **Software and Access:** Job scheduling is managed via Slurm, employing a fair-share policy.14 Users can access the cluster via SSH using NAU credentials after requesting an account.26 A web portal (OnDemand) is also available.27 The ARC group provides support, including data science consulting and development assistance.28 Requesting specific GPU types (e.g., \#SBATCH \--gpus=a100) and monitoring GPU utilization (via gpu\_status or nvidia-smi dmon) are supported functionalities.13  
* **Access Policy:** Monsoon is designated primarily for research purposes (funded or unfunded) by NAU faculty, staff, and sponsored students.26 The policy explicitly states it is *not* for general educational use, although service requests for "Classroom Access" are mentioned.26 This distinction creates potential friction with the increasing need for hands-on HPC/GPU experience in data science and AI curricula, as promoted by initiatives like TRAIL.15 While a mechanism for classroom access might exist, its scope, ease of use, and resource allocation compared to research access require clarification to ensure educational goals can be met effectively. The availability of only 27 GPUs across various types 13, while valuable, could become a bottleneck as AI/ML research and potentially teaching demands grow.

### **Specialized Labs**

Discipline-specific labs provide additional computational and analytical resources:

* **GIS Labs:** Both the School of Forestry 30 and the Department of Geography, Planning & Recreation 7 maintain GIS labs, equipped with software like ArcGIS.47  
* **Forestry Research Labs:** Various labs support specialized research within Forestry, such as forest ecology, biometrics, and silviculture.30  
* **Ecological Restoration Institute (ERI):** ERI facilities support its research, outreach, and educational mission in forest health and restoration.9  
* **Ecoinformatics Labs:** Labs associated with Ecoinformatics faculty provide resources for computational ecology and environmental data analysis.11

### **Software and Tools**

Access to appropriate software is critical for AI and data science work:

* **GIS/RS Software:** Standard tools like ArcGIS are available and utilized in relevant programs.7 Other specialized software may be used within GIS/RS degree programs.4  
* **Statistical Software:** Standard statistical packages (e.g., R) are likely used in statistics and data science courses, though specific software confirmation is needed for courses like FOR 128/372.32  
* **Programming Languages:** Python and R are fundamental for data science and are likely integral to the BS Data Science, CS minor, GIS, and Informatics programs.1 Confirmation is needed for languages taught in specific CS and INF courses.32  
* **AI/ML Tools:** Microsoft Copilot is provided university-wide for faculty, staff, and students.15 Access to specialized AI/ML libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) on Monsoon depends on ARC support for software installation and maintenance.27 The SICCS AI/ML faculty search mentions interest in specific areas like reinforcement learning, suggesting potential use of associated frameworks.57

Overall, NAU provides a solid baseline of computational infrastructure with the Monsoon cluster and specialized labs. The university-wide provision of Microsoft Copilot lowers the barrier for entry into using generative AI tools. However, ensuring adequate and appropriate access to HPC resources (especially GPUs) for both research and potentially expanding educational needs, along with robust support for specialized AI/ML software, will be crucial for future growth.

## **Governance, Ethics, and Responsible AI**

NAU has established policies and guidelines addressing research integrity, academic honesty, and the emerging challenges posed by artificial intelligence, aiming to foster a responsible environment for scholarship and learning.

### **Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR)**

NAU mandates RCR training for individuals involved in research, aligning with federal agency requirements.29

* **Policy and Requirements:** The university requires RCR training for faculty, students, postdocs, and staff engaged in research, with specific mandates for those supported by NIH and NSF grants.29 Training involves both online CITI modules (discipline-specific) and at least four hours of face-to-face instruction (workshops, courses, mentoring).29 NIH requires a minimum of nine hours total for its supported personnel, acknowledged via an NAU RCR Credential.29 NSF requires training for funded students and postdocs, including mentor training.29  
* **Covered Topics:** Standard RCR topics are covered, including research ethics, data acquisition/management/sharing, publication practices/authorship, conflict of interest, collaborative science, human/animal subjects protection, and research misconduct.29  
* **AI Ethics Integration:** The current list of mandated RCR topics 29 does not explicitly include AI-specific ethical considerations such as algorithmic bias, data privacy in machine learning, AI accountability, or responsible AI development/deployment. While NAU addresses AI ethics through separate guidelines 15, integrating these concepts directly into the formal RCR training framework, similar to practices at institutions like UCSF 86, would ensure broader awareness and reinforce their importance as core components of research integrity in the modern era.

### **Academic Integrity**

NAU's Academic Integrity policy emphasizes honesty, trustworthiness, fairness, and responsibility.18

* **Policy on AI:** The policy explicitly states that using AI to generate graded work without instructor permission constitutes academic dishonesty.18 This places the onus on instructors to clearly define acceptable and unacceptable uses of AI tools within their specific courses and assignments.15 The policy outlines procedures for handling violations, potentially involving the Academic Integrity Hearing Board.18  
* **Instructor Responsibility:** Faculty are responsible for setting clear expectations regarding AI use in their syllabi.15 This approach allows for disciplinary flexibility but necessitates clear communication to avoid student confusion and requires institutional support (like providing sample syllabus statements) to ensure consistency and fairness.

### **AI Usage Guidelines**

NAU provides distinct guidelines for faculty and students regarding the use of generative AI.

* **Faculty Guidance:** Faculty are encouraged to communicate AI policies clearly, avoid mandating AI use (providing alternatives), exercise caution with AI detection tools (recognizing their limitations), experiment with AI pedagogically, and consider AI's impact when making curricular decisions.15 Sample syllabus statements are provided, ranging from prohibited use to open use with attribution.15  
* **Student Guidance:** Students are advised to understand instructor policies, use AI to enhance (not replace) learning, critically verify AI-generated information, adhere to usage restrictions, and avoid sharing sensitive data.17 The guidance also addresses accessibility concerns, encouraging students to discuss alternatives with instructors if AI tools pose barriers.17  
* **Foundational Principles:** NAU aligns its approach with broader higher education principles emphasizing human-centeredness, digital inclusion and literacy, using AI to enhance learning, and recognizing lifelong learning needs.16

### **Data Handling and Privacy**

Protecting sensitive data is a key component of NAU's AI governance.

* **Policy:** Users are explicitly prohibited from inputting sensitive university data (classified above Level 2, including prospective student records, financial data, usernames, etc.) into generative AI tools, including university-sanctioned tools like Microsoft Copilot.15 Students are also warned against entering personal or proprietary information.17 This reflects an understanding of the risks associated with data privacy when using AI platforms.88  
* **HPC Data Policy:** For the Monsoon cluster, only /home directories are backed up; data in /scratch and /project is not routinely backed up.26 Data is retained for 6 months after a user loses NAU affiliation.26 Researchers using the HPC must be aware of these policies and manage their data accordingly.

Effective implementation of data handling policies requires ongoing user education and potentially technical controls to minimize accidental disclosure of sensitive information.

### **Ethical Considerations**

NAU acknowledges the broader ethical dimensions of AI.

* **Awareness:** Institutional communications and guidelines reflect an awareness of key AI ethical challenges, such as bias, fairness, transparency, accountability, and privacy.15 The university commits to upholding high ethical standards in research and education.18  
* **Action:** The TRAIL program requires grant proposals to consider ethical implications.21 Faculty are encouraged to discuss ethics with students 15, and students are guided to critically evaluate AI outputs for bias.17 The Generative AI in Education Task Force report also likely addresses ethical considerations.89

While foundational ethical principles are emphasized, developing specific institutional expertise and potentially dedicated coursework in AI ethics could further strengthen NAU's position.

## **Strategic Positioning and Future Directions**
