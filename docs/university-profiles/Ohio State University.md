# **Ohio State University**

## **I. OSU's SAF-Accredited Forestry Program**

The Ohio State University (OSU) offers education in forestry within a broad environmental and agricultural context. Understanding the administrative placement and specific structure of the program is essential for analyzing its capacity to integrate advanced computational methodologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Data Science, and High-Performance Computing (HPC).

**Administrative Home: School of Environment and Natural Resources (SENR) within CFAES**

The Society of American Foresters (SAF)-accredited forestry program at OSU resides within the **School of Environment and Natural Resources (SENR)**. SENR, in turn, is an academic unit within the larger **College of Food, Agricultural, and Environmental Sciences (CFAES)**. This administrative structure situates the forestry program alongside other environmental and natural resource disciplines, such as environmental science, environmental policy, natural resource management, and fisheries and wildlife science, as well as broader agricultural sciences housed within CFAES.

This placement within SENR and CFAES fosters an environment where forestry is viewed as part of an interconnected system of environmental and agricultural concerns. Such a structure inherently encourages interdisciplinary thinking and potential collaboration within the environmental and agricultural sciences domains housed within the college. However, this organizational model, where forestry is integrated within a larger school rather than existing as a standalone college (a structure seen historically at other institutions), may also introduce a degree of administrative or cultural separation from departments central to advanced computational sciences, such as Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) in the College of Engineering or the Department of Statistics and the Translational Data Analytics Institute (TDAI) within the College of Arts and Sciences and the Enterprise for Research, Innovation and Knowledge. Consequently, while the SENR/CFAES structure provides a strong foundation in environmental science and resource management, accessing and integrating cutting-edge computational techniques from outside the college might require more deliberate cross-college initiatives or student effort compared to institutions with different organizational structures.

**Specific Major and Specialization: FFW and Forest Ecosystem Science & Management**

The undergraduate pathway for students pursuing forestry is the **Bachelor of Science in Environment and Natural Resources** degree. Within this degree, the relevant major is **Forestry, Fisheries, and Wildlife (FFW)**. The FFW major is designed to prepare students for addressing conservation concerns across these interconnected fields, emphasizing the complex interactions between humans and the environment and incorporating hands-on learning.

All FFW students undertake a core set of courses covering natural and human dimensions of the environment before specializing. The specialization most directly aligned with traditional forestry and meeting SAF accreditation standards is **Forest Ecosystem Science and Management**. This specialization focuses on managing forests for diverse objectives, including timber production, wildlife habitat, and recreation, aiming to promote holistic ecosystem health. An alternative, interdisciplinary specialization combining **Forestry and Wildlife** is also available.

The combined nature of the FFW major, encompassing three distinct but related fields, suggests a curriculum designed to provide a broad ecological foundation before specialization. This structure, while promoting an integrated understanding of natural resource management, might inherently limit the number of credit hours dedicated solely to advanced forestry topics, including specialized computational methods, within the major's required coursework compared to a program focused exclusively on forestry. Advanced computational training, therefore, may often be pursued through elective courses, minors, or dual majors.

**SAF Accreditation Confirmation**

The **Forest Ecosystem Science and Management** specialization within the FFW major explicitly provides the coursework necessary for professional certification by the **Society of American Foresters (SAF)**. OSU's SENR is recognized as offering SAF-accredited programs. SAF accreditation serves as a non-governmental, peer-review process ensuring the quality of postsecondary forestry education, verifying that programs meet standards established by the profession. It is often considered the "gold standard" for forest management professionals and may be a requirement or preferred qualification for certain federal, state, or private sector positions, or for specific certifications and licensing. The accreditation signifies that the OSU program delivers a curriculum covering essential areas such as ecology and forest biology, measurement of forest resources (including foundational quantitative skills like biometrics/mensuration), management of forest resources, and forest resource policy, economics, and administration. This provides a baseline expectation for quantitative training within the core forestry curriculum.

## **II. Curriculum Analysis: Forestry Program Integration (GIS, RS, Biometrics, Quantitative Methods)**

The curriculum for the FFW major, particularly the Forest Ecosystem Science and Management specialization, incorporates foundational courses relevant to Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Remote Sensing (RS), biometrics, and general quantitative methods, aligning with SAF accreditation requirements.

**Core Quantitative and Spatial Courses within FFW**

Analysis of the curriculum requirements reveals the following core components integrated within the FFW major structure:

* **Forest Biometrics:** **ENR 3323: Forest Biometrics** (3 credit hours) is a required course for students specializing in Forest Ecosystem Science and Management and the Forestry and Wildlife dual specialization. This course directly addresses the core SAF requirement for skills in the measurement of forest resources, often termed forest mensuration. It provides foundational training in quantitative techniques specific to forestry inventory and analysis.  
* **Introduction to Spatial Information:** **ENR 3700: Introduction to Spatial Information for Environment and Natural Resources** (3 credit hours) is a required course within the SENR Core for all FFW majors. This course serves as the primary introduction to geospatial technologies within the school, covering basic principles of GIS, remote sensing (RS), and the Global Positioning System (GPS), including spatial data models, map projections, and basic analysis techniques using software like QGIS, Google Earth, and ArcGIS. It aims to develop a basic understanding of spatial information management and its application to environmental problems.  
* **Foundational Data Analysis/Statistics:** The FFW curriculum mandates a foundational course in Mathematical and Quantitative Reasoning or Data Analysis. The curriculum guide for students starting Autumn 2022 or later indicates **Math 1151 (Calculus I)** or **Math 1156 (Calculus for Business)** fulfills this. While essential, this fulfills a general university requirement rather than providing specific natural resource data analysis skills. SAF accreditation standards emphasize the need for statistics and sampling coursework within the "Measurement of Forest Resources" area. Students may meet this through various introductory statistics courses offered across the university (e.g., STAT 1450, STAT 2450, STAT 2480). Within SENR itself, **ENR 2000: Natural Resources Data Analysis** (3 credit hours) exists and is required for the NRM major, potentially serving as an elective or recommended course for FFW students seeking more domain-specific introductory analysis skills, possibly using software like R.

**Modeling and Management Courses**

Several courses focus on ecological principles and management, likely incorporating conceptual or potentially quantitative models:

* **ENR 3322: Forest Ecosystems** (3 credit hours) and **ENR 3333: Silviculture** (3 credit hours) are required for forestry specializations. These courses cover the biological principles and management techniques for forest stands and ecosystems, forming the basis for applying more advanced modeling approaches.  
* Higher-level courses like **ENR 5320: Forest Management** (3 credit hours) and **ENR 5340: Forest Ecosystem Management** (3 credit hours) delve deeper into management planning and decision-making, which often involves the application of various modeling tools, although the specific computational intensity is not detailed in the course titles alone.

**Advanced Quantitative Electives within SENR**

While the core FFW curriculum focuses on foundational skills, SENR offers some advanced quantitative coursework, primarily at the graduate level:

* **ENR 8780: Multivariate Analysis for Ecologists** (3 credit hours). This graduate-level course covers advanced multivariate statistical methods relevant to ecological research, utilizing real data sets from forestry, fisheries, and wildlife. Its prerequisite is **STAT 5302 (Intermediate Data Analysis II)** or equivalent, indicating it builds upon a significant statistics background. While highly relevant, its 8000-level designation suggests that undergraduate access might require instructor permission or specific circumstances, positioning it primarily as a graduate training opportunity.

**Accessibility of GIS Minor and External Courses**

For students seeking deeper expertise in geospatial technologies, the **Geographic Information Science Minor**, offered by the Department of Geography in the College of Arts and Sciences, is a viable and recommended path.

* **GIS Minor Requirements:** The minor typically requires 15 to 18 credit hours.1 *Note: There appears to be a discrepancy in total credits required (15 vs. 18\) and required core credits (9 vs. 12\) between different source documents.1 Students should consult current Geography department advising materials.* Core requirements generally include **GEOG 4103** (Introductory Spatial Data Analysis), **GEOG 5200** (Cartography and Map Design), **GEOG 5210** (Fundamentals of Geographic Information Systems), and a choice between **GEOG 5212** (Geospatial Databases for GIS) or **GEOG 5225** (Geographic Applications of Remote Sensing).1  
* **GIS Minor Electives:** Elective options allow students to delve into more advanced topics, such as **GEOG 5222** (GIS Algorithms and Programming), **GEOG 5226** (Spatial Simulation and Modeling in GIS), and **GEOG 5103** (Intermediate Spatial Data Analytics).1  
* **Remote Sensing Focus:** While ENR 3700 provides an introduction, specialized remote sensing knowledge is primarily gained through Geography courses like **GEOG 5225**, accessible via the GIS minor or as electives if prerequisites are met.

The structure of the FFW curriculum ensures graduates meet SAF standards with foundational knowledge in biometrics (ENR 3323\) and introductory GIS/RS (ENR 3700). However, achieving proficiency in advanced GIS, remote sensing analysis, geospatial programming, data science, AI/ML techniques, or complex simulation modeling necessitates coursework beyond the standard FFW specialization requirements. Students must proactively pursue these skills through minors, such as the GIS minor offered by Geography, or by carefully selecting electives from other departments like Geography, Statistics, or Computer Science and Engineering, often requiring fulfillment of prerequisite sequences in mathematics, statistics, or programming.2 The path to advanced computational competency for forestry undergraduates at OSU is thus inherently interdisciplinary, guiding students outward from the core FFW curriculum. The presence of graduate-level courses like ENR 8780 within SENR demonstrates capacity for advanced quantitative ecology, but reinforces that deep computational training within the school is primarily geared towards graduate studies.

*Note: Status based on typical requirements; students should verify with current curriculum guides. STAT requirement met by various courses.*

## **III. Curriculum Analysis: Broader University Opportunities (AI, ML, HPC, Data Analytics)**

Beyond the core SENR and FFW curriculum, The Ohio State University offers a wide array of courses in AI, ML, HPC, data analytics, and related computational fields, primarily housed within the College of Engineering (Computer Science and Engineering \- CSE) and the College of Arts and Sciences (Statistics, Geography). However, accessing these courses presents varying degrees of challenge for undergraduate students in the FFW program due to prerequisites and potential enrollment restrictions.

**Advanced AI and Machine Learning Courses (Primarily CSE)**

OSU provides several courses covering foundational and advanced AI/ML topics:

* **CSE 3521: Survey of Artificial Intelligence I: Basic Techniques** (3 units) 2: Introduces fundamental AI concepts like problem-solving, knowledge representation, and basic ML. A significant barrier exists for FFW students, as prerequisites include CSE 2331 (Foundations I, a discrete structures course) and enrollment is restricted to CSE, CIS, ECE, or Data Analytics majors.2  
* **CSE 5523: Machine Learning and Statistical Pattern Recognition** (3 units) 3: Covers classification, clustering, data representation, and theoretical analysis. Prerequisites are substantial: CSE 3521 (or equivalent AI/Data Mining course like 5521 or 5243), an advanced statistics course (STAT 3460 or 3470), and linear algebra (Math 2568 or equivalent). Notably, these prerequisites are waived for students with graduate standing, making the course significantly more accessible to MS or PhD students than undergraduates outside the specified majors.  
* **CSE 5526: Introduction to Neural Networks** (3 units): An elective within the Data Analytics major's Computational Analytics specialization. Prerequisites are not listed in the snippet but are likely comparable to other 5000-level CSE ML courses.  
* **CSE 5442: High Performance Computing for AI/ML** (3 units): An elective course specifically combining HPC and AI/ML, focusing on distributed training principles and methods (data, model, hybrid parallelism) and HPC system architectures. Prerequisites likely involve a solid CSE background.  
* **Other AI/ML Courses:** Various other institutions and departments within OSU also offer AI/ML related coursework, reflecting the technology's broad applicability.

**High-Performance Computing (HPC) Courses and Training**

Formal HPC coursework appears concentrated in CSE:

* **CSE 5442: High Performance Computing for AI/ML** (see above).  
* **OSC Training:** The Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC) provides introductory workshops and online training modules covering HPC concepts, hardware/software, storage, web portal usage (OnDemand), and batch processing. These resources are generally open to all OSC users and potential users and may represent a more accessible entry point for FFW students compared to formal CSE courses.

**Data Analytics and Science Courses (Statistics, Geography, ISE)**

A strong suite of courses exists for data analysis, modeling, and visualization:

* **Department of Statistics:** Offers a comprehensive range of courses.  
  * *Introductory:* STAT 1350, 1430, 1450, 2450, 2480 cover basic statistics for various audiences.  
  * *Data Analytics Core Sequence:* STAT 3201 (Probability), STAT 3202 (Inference), STAT 3301 (Modeling I \- Linear Regression), STAT 3302 (Modeling II \- GLMs, Multivariate), STAT 3303 (Bayesian Analysis) form the statistical core of the Data Analytics major. These require Calculus II (Math 1152\) and build sequentially.  
  * *Advanced/Applied:* STAT 4620 (Introduction to Statistical Learning) builds on the DA core (requires STAT 3302\) and focuses on statistical models for big data.4 Other relevant courses include STAT 5301/5302 (Intermediate Data Analysis I/II), STAT 6500 (Statistical Machine Learning), STAT 6530 (Introduction to Spatial Statistics), and STAT 6730 (Introduction to Computational Statistics). STAT 5730 offers an introduction to R for data science.  
* **Department of Geography:** Provides specialized courses in spatial data handling.  
  * **GEOG 4103: Introductory Spatial Data Analysis** and **GEOG 5103: Intermediate Spatial Data Analysis** focus on quantitative geographical methods, including spatial regression techniques. GEOG 5103 requires an introductory statistics course.  
  * **GEOG 5226: Spatial Simulation and Modeling in GIS** (3 units) covers techniques like cellular automata and agent-based modeling for environmental and social systems. Prerequisite information is inconsistent across documents; newer sources state it's not open to students with credit for GEOG 5221 or 685, while older documents list no prerequisite. Familiarity with GIS software is expected.  
* **Department of Integrated Systems Engineering (ISE):** Contributes courses to the Data Analytics major.  
  * **ISE 3230: Systems Modeling and Optimization for Analytics** is part of the DA core.  
  * **ISE 5760: Visual Analytics and Sensemaking** is an option for the DA visualization requirement.

**Relevant Minors and Certificates**

Students can structure their exploration of these areas through minors or certificates:

* **GIS Minor (Geography):** 15-18 credits. Accessible and recommended for FFW students.1 Provides a pathway to GEOG 5103 and 5226\.  
* **Business Analytics Minor (Fisher College of Business):** 9 core credits \+ electives. Focuses on business decision-making using data. Requires economics, basic CSE, and math prerequisites. Less aligned with typical FFW goals and requires business prerequisites.  
* **Statistics Minor (Undergraduate):** 13 credits, requires STAT 3201, 3202, 3301 \+ elective. Requires Calculus II and typically takes four semesters to complete. A rigorous option requiring significant math/stats background. Not available to Data Analytics majors.  
* **Data Analytics Minor:** OSU does *not* currently offer an undergraduate minor specifically titled "Data Analytics". Students seeking this breadth are directed to minors in CIS, CSE, Statistics, or Business Analytics. This lack of a general DA minor forces students into more specialized pathways, which might be a hurdle for FFW students wanting broad data science skills without the depth or prerequisites of a full Stats or CSE minor.  
* **GIST Graduate Certificate (Geography):** 12 graduate credits, including GEOG 5210 and electives like 5103, 5225, 5226, 5222\. An option for post-baccalaureate students or potentially graduate students in SENR.  
* **Other Graduate Minors:** Statistical Data Analysis, Statistics, Computer Science are available at the graduate level.

Overall, OSU possesses a rich and diverse portfolio of advanced computational courses relevant to forestry applications. However, undergraduate FFW students face considerable hurdles in accessing many of these, especially the core AI/ML courses in CSE, due to stringent prerequisites and major restrictions. Graduate students generally encounter fewer formal barriers to enrolling in these advanced courses. The Department of Geography, through its GIS minor and courses like GEOG 5103 and GEOG 5226, offers a comparatively more accessible route for FFW undergraduates to acquire intermediate-to-advanced skills in spatial analysis and modeling.1 Successfully integrating deep computational skills requires early and careful academic planning, often involving the pursuit of a minor or significant elective coursework outside the primary FFW curriculum.

He has a stated interest in integrating geospatial technology and data into his work on land use, farmer behavior, and human dimensions of environmental models.  
* **Other SENR Faculty:** The school hosts a diverse faculty covering soils, hydrology, policy, fisheries, wildlife, restoration, and sociology. While not all explicitly focus on AI/ML/HPC in the provided materials, many likely utilize quantitative and modeling techniques within their specific domains (e.g., soil science faculty like Scott Demyan or Manbir Rakkar, fisheries faculty like Konrad Dabrowski, wildlife faculty like Robert Gates or Risa Pesapane). Faculty associated with the Terrestrial Wildlife Ecology Lab (TWEL) also contribute to quantitative ecological research.5

**Affiliated Faculty Expertise Across OSU**

The potential for advanced computational applications in forestry is significantly enhanced by expertise residing in other OSU departments and interdisciplinary institutes:

* **Department of Geography:** This department houses significant strength in GIScience, spatial analysis, and modeling.  
  * **Desheng Liu:** Specializes in Remote Sensing, Spatial Statistics, GIScience, and Land Cover Change modeling, teaching relevant courses and publishing on spatial-temporal modeling and remote sensing techniques.7 He is a TDAI affiliate and co-leads the Sensing-Driven Collaborative Science Community of Practice.  
  * **Ningchuan Xiao:** Focuses on machine learning for spatial data, spatial optimization, computational cartography, and algorithms.8 His research includes using ML for map recognition and developing spatial optimization frameworks.8  
  * **Harvey Miller:** Expertise in GIS, spatial analysis of mobility, and spatio-temporal data.

The department hosts a research group specifically focused on Spatial Statistics and Environmental Statistics (STAT 8750.06). Faculty like Jianyong Wu (affiliated with Public Health) bring expertise in spatial epidemiology and environmental health data science.  
* **Translational Data Analytics Institute (TDAI):** Serves as a crucial interdisciplinary hub, connecting many of the faculty mentioned above. TDAI core faculty include experts from Statistics (Paul), ISE (Rayo), Geography (Liu, Quiring), CEGE (Carrel, Qin), and FABE (Drewry), alongside CSE (Berger-Wolf). Its structure facilitates collaboration across colleges.  
* **Department of Food, Agricultural, and Biological Engineering (FABE):** Houses expertise in Digital Agriculture, Precision Agriculture, and related modeling. Faculty like Lorrayne Miralha (Watershed Modeling, Data Analytics using spatial stats, GIS, ML) and Ajay Shah (Precision Ag, remote sensing, ML for crop/soil health) apply computational methods directly to agricultural and potentially related environmental systems.

This distribution of expertise indicates that while SENR possesses strong internal capabilities in quantitative ecology, forest modeling, and foundational spatial analysis (Zhao, Matthews, Hix), the cutting edge of AI, ML, advanced spatial statistics, and HPC application often resides in affiliated departments like Geography, CSE, and Statistics, or within interdisciplinary structures like TDAI and the NSF AI Institutes. This necessitates cross-unit collaboration for forestry researchers aiming to leverage the most advanced computational techniques. The potential for synergistic research is high, given the presence of experts like Zhao (forestry background, ML/RS expertise), Su (core AI/ML, biology applications via Imageomics), Berger-Wolf (computational ecology, AI), Liu (spatial stats, RS), and others. However, realizing this potential depends on effective communication, shared research goals, and potentially formalized collaborative structures or joint appointments between SENR and these other units. The strong cluster of faculty focused on spatial analysis, remote sensing, and environmental modeling across SENR, Geography, and TDAI represents a significant institutional strength for OSU in computational environmental science applicable to forestry.

## **V. High-Performance Computing Infrastructure (Ohio Supercomputer Center \- OSC)**

The Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC) serves as the primary provider of centralized high-performance computing (HPC), storage, and related support services for researchers at The Ohio State University and other academic and industrial clients across Ohio. Its resources are critical for computationally demanding tasks common in modern environmental modeling, data science, AI, and ML applications relevant to forestry.

**Overview and Access**

OSC aims to provide state-of-the-art, scalable computing resources to accelerate research and innovation. A key feature facilitating access is the **Open OnDemand** web portal, an OSC-developed, open-source interface that allows users to manage files, submit and monitor jobs, access command-line interfaces, and run graphical applications directly through a web browser, significantly lowering the barrier to entry for users less familiar with traditional HPC environments.

**Compute Clusters and GPU Resources**

OSC maintains several HPC clusters, with a notable and increasing emphasis on GPU computing to support the demands of AI and ML workloads:

* **Pitzer:** An established cluster featuring Intel Xeon CPUs (Skylake and Cascade Lake generations) and NVIDIA Volta V100 GPUs. The V100 GPUs have either 16GB or 32GB of memory, with some nodes offering NVLink interconnects for faster GPU-to-GPU communication. Pitzer nodes typically have 2 GPUs each.  
* **Ascend:** Launched in late 2022/early 2023 and expanded in 2025, Ascend is OSC's first cluster specifically designed with a strong focus on GPU computing for AI, data analytics, and ML. It utilizes AMD EPYC CPUs and features a large number of NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs. The A100s come in two configurations: nodes with four 80GB GPUs connected via NVLink, and nodes (added in 2025\) with two 40GB PCIe GPUs. Ascend offers a theoretical peak performance of approximately 14 PetaFLOPS and houses 596 GPUs in total.  
* **Cardinal:** OSC's newest cluster, becoming available in spring 2025\. It is equipped with NVIDIA H100 GPUs, featuring 94GB of memory per GPU and NVLink interconnects, representing the latest generation of accelerators for AI and scientific computing. Nodes contain 4 H100 GPUs.

This progression from V100s (Pitzer) to A100s (Ascend) and H100s (Cardinal) demonstrates OSC's commitment to providing access to cutting-edge GPU technology essential for training large AI models and running complex simulations. Accessing these GPUs requires specifying the resource request in job submission scripts (e.g., using \#SBATCH \--gpus-per-node=x in the SLURM scheduler).

**Relevant Software and Storage**

OSC provides a wide range of software relevant to computational forestry and environmental science:

* **AI/ML/Data Analytics:** Core frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch are available, along with Horovod for distributed training. Programming languages Python (with numerous scientific libraries) and R are supported, accessible via command line or through interactive applications like Jupyter and RStudio on OnDemand. MATLAB is also available. Big data frameworks Spark and Hadoop are mentioned.  
* **GPU Programming:** Multiple versions of the NVIDIA CUDA toolkit are installed, providing compilers (nvcc) and libraries (cuBLAS, cuSPARSE, cuFFT, cuDNN) essential for GPU development and acceleration. The NVIDIA HPC SDK (NVHPC) offers C, C++, and Fortran compilers with integrated support for GPU acceleration via CUDA, OpenACC, and standard language parallelism.  
* **Domain-Specific Software:** While comprehensive lists of environmental or forestry-specific packages (e.g., FVS, specialized GIS/RS tools beyond base R/Python libraries) are not detailed in the provided snippets, OSC supports a broad range of scientific applications. OSC also supports container technologies (like Docker or Singularity/Apptainer), allowing researchers to package and run their own specialized software environments on the clusters. This provides flexibility but may require more user effort than using pre-installed modules.  
* **Storage:** OSC provides ample storage, including home directories (smaller quota, backed up), project space (larger quota, backed up, requires PI request), and high-performance scratch space (temporary, no quota). Tools like SFTP and Globus facilitate data transfer. Total available disk storage is around 18 PB, with significant tape backup capacity.

**Access Policies and Costs for OSU Users**

Access to OSC resources is straightforward and heavily subsidized for the OSU community:

* **Eligibility:** Full-time OSU faculty and research scientists qualify as Principal Investigators (PIs) and can request projects. Graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, staff, and undergraduate students gain access as authorized users under an eligible PI's project.  
* **Cost:** For Ohio academic users, access is highly subsidized by the state. Usage typically accrues against an annual credit (amounts like $1000/year were mentioned for other Ohio universities, suggesting a similar model for OSU). Fees are generally only charged for usage exceeding this credit or for premium services like dedicated nodes or higher queue priority. TDAI also provides OSC project codes or access for its funded research pilots and core faculty needs.  
* **Classroom Use:** Instructors at Ohio academic institutions can request free access to OSC resources for their courses by submitting a syllabus. A dedicated portal (class.osc.edu) may be used for some courses.  
* **Account Creation:** Users sign up via the MyOSC portal (my.osc.edu) and must associate their account with an active project (either by joining an existing project with an access code or having a PI request a new project).  
* **SENR/CFAES Access:** Faculty, staff, and students within SENR and CFAES access OSC under the standard Ohio Academic policies. There are no specific barriers mentioned; access depends on PI eligibility or association with a PI or classroom project. OSC conducts outreach and training workshops accessible to the OSU community, including CFAES/SENR personnel.  
* **Sensitive Data:** OSC provides a Protected Data Service (PDS) designed to meet common security requirements for handling data subject to regulations like HIPAA or potentially export controls (ITAR/EAR), though CUI is not currently supported. PIs must declare the need for handling such data.

In summary, OSC provides OSU's forestry program members with affordable access to powerful, state-of-the-art HPC and GPU infrastructure suitable for demanding computational tasks in modeling, simulation, data analysis, and AI/ML. The Open OnDemand portal enhances accessibility, particularly for those less experienced with traditional HPC environments. While core AI/ML and data science software is readily available, researchers needing highly specialized forestry or geospatial software might need to utilize containers or work with OSC support for installation. The subsidized access model removes significant financial barriers for academic research and classroom use.

## **VI. Strategic Alignment and Institutional Priorities**

The extent to which AI, ML, Data Science, and HPC are integrated into OSU's forestry program is influenced by the strategic priorities set at the university, college, and school levels. Examining these strategic plans reveals varying degrees of emphasis on advanced computation and data analytics.

**University-Level Commitment to AI and Computational Research**

The Ohio State University, through its overarching strategic plans and the Enterprise for Research, Innovation and Knowledge (ERIK), clearly prioritizes research excellence, knowledge generation, and the development of impactful solutions to societal challenges. Within this broad vision, **Artificial Intelligence** has been identified as a major institutional strength and focus area. OSU highlights substantial federal funding ($235M from FY15-22), over 300 faculty members engaged in AI research, and significant infrastructure investments, including OSC and participation in major NSF AI Institutes (AI-EDGE, ICICLE, Imageomics). The university's AI research portfolio explicitly includes foundational AI, enabling cyberinfrastructure (HPC, networking, big data analytics, sensing), trustworthy AI (ethics, fairness, security), and applications in key areas such as **Digital Agriculture and Food Systems**, **Climate and Earth Science**, and **Energy** – all highly relevant to forestry and environmental science. This top-level commitment creates a supportive environment and provides resources for computationally intensive research across disciplines.

**Translational Data Analytics Institute (TDAI) Priorities**

TDAI plays a pivotal role in operationalizing the university's AI and data science strategy. Its unique focus is on **"translational" data analytics**, emphasizing the bridge between foundational quantitative and computational techniques and their application to real-world problems, including critical implementation aspects like human factors, policy, and ethics. TDAI's strategic goals involve fostering interdisciplinary research communities, developing talent through programs like its Professional Science Master's degree, building external partnerships, and creating shared data resources (Data Commons). Crucially, TDAI's strategic research directions and funding priorities explicitly include **Foundations of AI and Data Science**, **Responsible and Ethical Data Science**, **Sensing-Driven Collaborative Science**, and application domains like **Health and Well-Being** and **Environment, Climate, and Sustainability**. This positions TDAI as a key enabler and potential funding source for research integrating AI/ML/Data Science into environmental fields like forestry.

**College of Food, Agricultural, and Environmental Sciences (CFAES) Priorities**

CFAES's strategic alignment emphasizes its land-grant mission, integrating research, teaching, and extension to serve stakeholders. A core challenge and priority is balancing viable agricultural production with environmental and ecosystem sustainability. Key goals include advancing scientific research for global challenges, effectively translating and communicating research for impact, supporting the workforce pipeline, and improving operational efficiency and infrastructure. Within this framework, **digital agriculture**, **precision agriculture**, and the use of **data-driven insights** are prominent themes. Initiatives like the eFields on-farm research program and the AgTech Innovation Hub explicitly incorporate data analytics, remote sensing, sensor technology, and increasingly, AI and ML, to improve farm management, efficiency, and climate resilience. This focus on data-intensive approaches in the broader agricultural context within CFAES creates a favorable environment for similar applications in forestry and natural resource management.

**School of Environment and Natural Resources (SENR) Priorities (2020-2023 Plan)**

The SENR strategic plan for 2020-2023 focused on core academic missions: providing excellent student-centered learning, making internationally recognized research contributions, integrating teaching, research, and outreach, engaging with stakeholders, and ensuring resource stewardship. Strategies included supporting diversity and inclusion, refining graduate curriculum, expanding experiential learning, seeding interdisciplinary research teams, improving research facilities, enhancing professional education programming (like the Environmental Professionals Network \- EPN), and improving communication and collaboration with Extension and other OSU units.

While goals like "fostering interdisciplinary work," "building research capacity," and "improving research infrastructure" could certainly encompass computational methods, the 2020-2023 plan, as documented in the provided materials, did not explicitly highlight AI, data science, or HPC as distinct strategic thrusts in the same way the university, TDAI, or even CFAES (via digital ag) did during that period. The emphasis was more on broad interdisciplinary environmental science and resource management goals. This suggests that while computational work was undoubtedly occurring within SENR (driven by faculty like Zhao and Matthews), its elevation to a school-level strategic priority might have been less pronounced compared to other units during this timeframe. Integration may have been driven more organically by faculty interests, student demand, and influence from broader university initiatives like TDAI. It is possible that subsequent strategic plans place greater explicit emphasis on these computational areas.

**Interplay and Implications**

The multi-layered strategic landscape at OSU presents both opportunities and complexities. The strong university and TDAI commitment to AI and data science provides significant momentum and resources. CFAES's focus on digital agriculture offers relevant parallels and potential collaborations for forestry. The land-grant mission embedded within CFAES and SENR encourages the application of these advanced computational tools to solve practical environmental and resource management problems, aligning well with the translational focus of TDAI. However, the lack of explicit high-level prioritization of AI/ML/HPC within the documented SENR 2020-23 plan might mean that targeted support or curriculum development specifically for computational forestry within the school requires navigating and leveraging resources from TDAI, OSC, Geography, CSE, or Statistics. Successfully integrating these technologies deeply into the forestry program likely depends on proactive faculty leadership within SENR to bridge these different units and align with the broader university and college priorities.

## **VII. Research Ecosystem: Centers, Projects, and Partnerships**

Ohio State University supports a rich ecosystem of research centers, interdisciplinary institutes, specific projects, and collaborative partnerships that facilitate the integration of AI, ML, data science, and HPC into environmental science and forestry.

* **Byrd Polar and Climate Research Center (BPCRC):** While focused on polar and climate science, BPCRC houses expertise and infrastructure relevant to environmental modeling. Its **Earth Systems Modeling Group** uses state-of-the-art computer models for climate simulation. The **Satellite Hydrology Group** utilizes satellite remote sensing and modeling for water resource studies. BPCRC provides project support and facilities for affiliated PIs.  
* **NSF AI Institutes at OSU:** OSU's participation in major NSF-funded AI Institutes, including **AI-EDGE** (Edge Networks), **ICICLE** (Cyberinfrastructure for AI), and **Imageomics** (AI for Biology/Biodiversity), brings significant federal resources, national visibility, and cutting-edge expertise to campus. Institutes like Imageomics, involving faculty like Yu Su and Tanya Berger-Wolf, directly overlap with environmental and biological data analysis.  
* **Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC):** Provides the foundational HPC infrastructure, software, and support services utilized by many of these centers and projects (See Section V).  
* **Center on Education and Training for Employment (CETE):** Focuses on AI literacy and the ethical integration of AI into education and training contexts.

**Specific Projects and Grants**

Numerous specific projects exemplify the application of computational methods:

* **NEON Mobile Sensor Tower Project:** Led by TDAI Director Tanya Berger-Wolf, this project deployed a NEON sensor tower at the OSU Airport to collect real-time urban environmental data (emissions, pollution, weather, soil conditions). A key component involves using AI and ML to interpret the complex sensor data streams and test edge computing approaches, serving as a pilot for the NSF AI Institutes.  
* **TDAI Research Pilot Projects:** TDAI provides seed funding for interdisciplinary teams. Examples relevant to environmental science or responsible AI include: "Smart Forests: Harnessing AI Satellite Remote Sensing to Halt Deforestation in Africa," exploring AI for remote monitoring; "AI as a Sanctioning Institution for Collective Action," using AI to study cooperation in resource dilemmas; and projects focused on fairness in AI algorithms. TDAI prioritizes projects related to Climate/Environment/Sustainability and Responsible Data Science.  
* **AgTech Innovation Hub Funded Projects:** Examples include automating drainage water management using sensors, mapping climate risk perceptions, using AI and precision ag data to predict crop yield differences related to planting dates, and enhancing biopesticides. A second round funded projects on alternative farm labor models, drone-based safety monitoring in controlled environments, climate adaptation tools via Extension, and upgrading weather monitoring systems.  
* **BioCLIP Project:** An Imageomics Institute project involving Yu Su (CSE) and Tanya Berger-Wolf (TDAI/CSE/EEOB) that developed a foundational vision model for classifying organisms across the tree of life using AI/ML.9  
* **NSF Funding:** Beyond the AI Institutes, OSU researchers participate in various NSF-funded projects. OSU is part of a $5.1M NSF grant aimed at accelerating AI/ML adoption in research across Ohio institutions (targeting materials, agriculture, biomedical fields) by providing expert support personnel. OSU faculty are also involved in NSF projects focused on specific AI techniques like safe reinforcement learning. The university is also a partner in the new NSF Leadership-Class Computing Facility (LCCF).

**Partnerships**

Collaboration is a hallmark of OSU's research ecosystem:

* **Internal Collaboration:** Extensive cross-unit collaboration is evident, particularly fostered by TDAI, which connects faculty across numerous colleges. Projects like the NEON tower and AgTech Hub involve multiple colleges (Engineering, Arts & Sciences, CFAES, Law, Public Affairs) and institutes (TDAI, SI). CFAES units like Extension and OARDC collaborate internally and with academic departments.  
* **External Partnerships:** OSU engages with federal agencies (NSF, NIH, USDA), industry partners (e.g., Nationwide, Ohio Farm Bureau in AgTech Hub; JPMC, Nationwide on TDAI advisory boards), non-profits, community groups, and other universities (e.g., CWRU, UC for NSF AI training grant; LCCF partnership). The eFields program relies heavily on partnerships with Ohio farmers. OSC serves industrial clients. International collaborations also exist (e.g., TDAI engagement with Midwest Big Data Hub).

This interconnected network of centers, projects, and partnerships creates a dynamic environment for computational research. For forestry, this means access to TDAI's data science expertise and pilot funding, potential collaboration with digital agriculture initiatives in CFAES, utilization of OSC's HPC resources, and connections to national AI initiatives through the NSF Institutes. While specific, large-scale AI/ML projects focused explicitly on Ohio forestry challenges were not prominently featured in the provided snippets (compared to agriculture or general environmental monitoring), the existing ecosystem provides the necessary infrastructure, expertise, and collaborative pathways for such projects to develop. The "Smart Forests" pilot, though focused elsewhere, demonstrates TDAI's openness to funding AI applications in forest monitoring. The strong emphasis on translational research and partnerships further suggests opportunities to develop computationally driven tools for practical forest management and conservation in Ohio.

## **VIII. Ethical Considerations in AI Implementation**

The increasing use of AI and data-intensive methods in research and application necessitates careful consideration of ethical implications. OSU addresses this through university-wide policies on research conduct, specific guidance related to AI in academic settings, and dedicated research initiatives focused on responsible AI.

**University-Level Framework for Responsible Conduct**

OSU mandates training in the **Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR)** for all faculty, staff, and students eligible to conduct research. This requirement is met primarily through the online Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) RCR course, which must be completed every four years. Discipline-specific modules are available (e.g., Physical Sciences, Social and Behavioral Research, Engineering). Federal funding agencies like NIH, NSF, and USDA NIFA have specific RCR training mandates, often requiring additional in-person instruction (minimum 8 hours) for trainees, fellows, postdocs, and certain faculty on specific grant types. OSU offers **GRADSCH 8000: Responsible Conduct of Research**, a 1-credit, in-person course designed to fulfill these federal requirements. Compliance is monitored, and failure to complete required training can result in suspension of access to research-related systems. While RCR training covers broad ethical principles like data management, authorship, and research integrity, it may not delve deeply into the specific nuances of AI ethics unless updated modules address this.

**AI-Specific Guidance and Education**

Recognizing the unique challenges posed by generative AI tools (like ChatGPT) and other AI applications, OSU provides guidance, primarily focused on the academic and teaching context:

* **Academic Integrity:** University policy prohibits unauthorized assistance and requires proper attribution of sources, applying to AI-generated content unless explicitly permitted by an instructor.  
* **Instructor Discretion and Policy:** Faculty have the autonomy to decide whether and how AI tools can be used in their courses. Clear communication of course-specific AI policies is strongly encouraged, detailing permitted tools, tasks, and citation requirements. Examples range from complete prohibition to allowing AI for specific tasks like grammar checks, citation generation, brainstorming, or understanding concepts, but typically not for submitting generated text as original work or during exams.  
* **Awareness of AI Limitations and Risks:** OSU resources caution educators and students about the limitations of generative AI, including its propensity to generate inaccurate information ("hallucinations"), fabricate citations, plagiarize, perpetuate biases (racial, gender, etc.), and lack true critical thinking or nuanced human expression. Users are advised to verify information, cross-reference sources, and remain critical of AI outputs.  
* **Privacy and Security:** Using third-party AI tools not vetted by the university poses risks. Entering institutional or sensitive personal data into public generative AI tools is discouraged due to privacy concerns and the potential for data incorporation into the model. Ethical AI tools should prioritize data protection, transparency, and user privacy.  
* **Ethics Curriculum:** Formal coursework addressing AI ethics is available. The Philosophy department offers **PHIL 2338: Computing Ethics for a Just and Diverse World** and incorporates AI ethics into engineering ethics courses (PHIL 1332, 2332, 7080). CSE offers **CSE 6521: Survey of Advanced Artificial Intelligence**, which includes a topic on "AI, Ethics, and Bias". OSU also provides access to LinkedIn Learning courses covering AI ethics, bias, and responsible use. The Drake Institute facilitates faculty learning about teaching with AI.

**SENR-Specific Context**

The available documentation does not indicate the existence of specific AI ethics policies, dedicated curriculum modules, or formalized training programs tailored explicitly for forestry or environmental science *within SENR*. While general RCR training is required, and individual courses may touch upon broader environmental ethics (e.g., ENR 5640), policy (ENR 3200), or the societal implications of spatial data (ENR 3700), there is no evidence presented of a structured approach within the school to address the unique ethical challenges arising from AI/ML in natural resource management. These challenges might include algorithmic bias in species distribution models, fairness considerations in resource allocation algorithms, transparency of predictive models used in policy decisions, privacy implications of large-scale environmental sensor networks, or the ethical use of AI in wildlife monitoring. Faculty and students in SENR likely rely on the general university RCR framework, OSU's broader AI guidance, and resources available through TDAI.

**TDAI and Law School Initiatives**

TDAI serves as a major center for AI ethics discussion and research at OSU:

* **Responsible Data Science CoP:** This TDAI Community of Practice brings together researchers from Law, Engineering, CSE, and other fields to study AI's societal impacts (bias, privacy, inequality, etc.) and develop solutions through policy, management, ethics, and technology. A key goal is developing educational curricula on responsible data science practices.  
* **Program on Data and Governance (PDG):** A collaboration between TDAI and the Moritz College of Law, led by Prof. Dennis Hirsch. PDG has conducted significant research into how businesses manage data ethics and responsible AI, producing reports and webinars. Their findings highlight the strategic importance companies place on RAIM, the common management practices (risk assessment, policies, ethics officers/committees), and the gap between perceived importance and actual implementation maturity.  
* **JusticeTech Program:** Another Moritz Law initiative involving TDAI, CSE, and the Institute for Cybersecurity and Digital Trust (ICDT), focused on using technology, including ethical AI applications, to improve access to justice.  
* **Funding and Education:** TDAI has funded pilot work on data ethics/bias course development and includes Responsible/Ethical Data Science as a strategic priority for funding.

The university possesses a solid foundation in RCR and is actively developing guidance and resources for the ethical use of AI, particularly in academic settings. However, specialized AI ethics considerations pertinent to environmental science and forestry seem largely unaddressed within SENR's formal structures or curriculum as documented. The primary locus for advanced research, discussion, and expertise on AI ethics resides within TDAI and its collaborations, particularly with the Moritz College of Law. SENR researchers and students seeking to navigate the ethical complexities of applying AI in their field would need to engage with these broader university resources. The current reliance on instructor discretion for AI use in coursework within SENR could lead to inconsistencies, suggesting a potential need for more unified guidance at the school or program level.

## **IX. Synthesis and Conclusions**

The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Data Science, and High-Performance Computing (HPC) into the Society of American Foresters (SAF)-accredited forestry program at The Ohio State University presents a complex picture characterized by foundational strengths, significant interdisciplinary opportunities, and potential areas for growth. Housed within the School of Environment and Natural Resources (SENR) in the College of Food, Agricultural, and Environmental Sciences (CFAES), the Forestry, Fisheries, and Wildlife (FFW) major, specifically the Forest Ecosystem Science and Management specialization, provides the SAF-accredited pathway.

**Curricular Integration:** The FFW curriculum successfully incorporates foundational quantitative and spatial skills required by SAF, notably through **ENR 3323: Forest Biometrics** and **ENR 3700: Introduction to Spatial Information for Environment and Natural Resources**. These courses provide essential grounding in forest measurement and basic GIS/RS principles. However, the curriculum structure, balancing forestry with fisheries and wildlife within the FFW major, means that advanced training in computational methods – including sophisticated GIS/RS analysis, spatial modeling, programming, data science, AI, and ML – largely resides outside the required FFW coursework. Students seeking these advanced skills must proactively pursue them through minors (like the accessible GIS minor in Geography 1), electives in departments such as Geography, Statistics, or Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), or potentially graduate-level coursework (like ENR 8780). Accessing advanced CSE courses, in particular, poses significant challenges for undergraduates due to stringent prerequisites and major restrictions, although these barriers are often lower for graduate students.2 The lack of a dedicated undergraduate minor in Data Analytics further complicates pathway planning for students seeking broad data science competency without committing to a full Statistics or CSE minor.

**Faculty Expertise:** SENR possesses valuable internal expertise in quantitative ecology, forest modeling, and spatial analysis, embodied by faculty such as Kaiguang Zhao, Stephen Matthews, and David Hix.5 However, the most cutting-edge expertise in core AI/ML, advanced spatial statistics, and HPC applications relevant to forestry is distributed across other OSU units, including Geography (Liu, Xiao, Miller), CSE (Su, Berger-Wolf, Arora), Statistics, and interdisciplinary hubs like TDAI.7 This structure underscores the necessity of interdisciplinary collaboration for advanced computational forestry research at OSU. The presence of TDAI and OSU's involvement in major NSF AI Institutes (Imageomics, ICICLE) provides significant institutional support, infrastructure, and potential funding pathways for such collaborations. A notable strength lies in the cluster of expertise around spatial analysis, remote sensing, and environmental modeling across SENR, Geography, and TDAI.

**Computational Infrastructure:** The Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC) provides OSU researchers, including those in SENR, with affordable access to state-of-the-art HPC resources. OSC features multiple clusters (Pitzer, Ascend, Cardinal) equipped with powerful CPUs and a significant, modern inventory of GPUs (NVIDIA V100, A100, H100) well-suited for demanding AI/ML training and complex simulations. Relevant software frameworks (Python, R, TensorFlow, PyTorch, CUDA, NVHPC SDK) and substantial storage are available. The user-friendly Open OnDemand portal lowers access barriers, and subsidized access for academic users removes significant cost constraints. While the core infrastructure is robust, researchers may need to utilize containers or request installations for highly specialized forestry software.

**Strategic Alignment:** A strong strategic push for AI, data science, and computational research exists at the university level (OSU/ERIK) and within key institutes like TDAI. This aligns with CFAES's emphasis on digital and precision agriculture. However, SENR's 2020-2023 strategic plan appeared less explicit in prioritizing these specific computational tools compared to broader environmental and interdisciplinary goals. This suggests that deeper integration within forestry might be currently driven more by faculty initiatives and leveraging external resources (TDAI, OSC, Geography, CSE) than by a specific top-down SENR mandate from that period. Nonetheless, the overall institutional environment, particularly the translational focus of TDAI and the land-grant mission of CFAES, is highly conducive to applying computational methods to practical forestry and NRM problems.

**Research Ecosystem:** OSU hosts a vibrant ecosystem supporting computational environmental science. TDAI acts as a central hub for funding, collaboration, and expertise. CFAES initiatives like the Digital Agriculture program/eFields and the AgTech Innovation Hub drive data-intensive research in related fields. Participation in NSF AI Institutes (Imageomics, ICICLE) brings national-level resources and expertise. While numerous projects apply AI/data science to agriculture and general environmental monitoring (e.g., NEON tower), projects specifically focused on applying cutting-edge AI/ML techniques to forestry challenges within Ohio seem less prominent in the documented portfolio, representing a potential area for future growth.

**Ethical Considerations:** OSU maintains a robust RCR training framework and provides guidance on AI use in academic settings, emphasizing instructor discretion, academic integrity, and awareness of AI limitations (bias, inaccuracy, privacy). However, specific AI ethics guidelines tailored to environmental research and NRM contexts are not evident within SENR's documented materials. TDAI and its partnership with the Moritz College of Law serve as the primary locus for research and discussion on responsible AI and data governance at OSU. SENR faculty and students likely need to engage with these broader resources to navigate the ethical dimensions of computational forestry.

**Overall Conclusion:** OSU's forestry program benefits from a strong institutional commitment to AI and data science, excellent HPC resources via OSC, and significant interdisciplinary expertise across campus. Foundational quantitative skills are integrated into the SAF-accredited curriculum. However, achieving deep integration of advanced AI, ML, and data science requires students and researchers to actively bridge connections with units like Geography, CSE, Statistics, and TDAI, primarily through minors, electives, and collaborative research, as the core FFW curriculum and SENR's explicit strategic focus (based on the 2020-23 plan) have limitations in providing this advanced training internally.
