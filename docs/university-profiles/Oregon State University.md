Oregon State University (OSU), a distinguished institution with Land, Sea, Space, and Sun Grant designations, stands as a premier public research university committed to impactful discoveries and addressing global challenges.1 Central to this mission is its College of Forestry (CoF), an entity with over a century of history and an international reputation as a leader in forestry education, research, and policy development for sustainable forest ecosystem management.1 The College aims to equip graduates with a comprehensive understanding of forest complexity, the associated economic and social systems, and the skills to effectively manage these resources in a diverse, global society.1

**B. Scope and Purpose of the Report**

This report provides an in-depth analysis of the integration and utilization of advanced computational methodologies – specifically Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Data Science (DS), and High-Performance Computing (HPC) – within the Society of American Foresters (SAF)-accredited forestry programs offered by OSU's College of Forestry. The investigation encompasses several key dimensions: the administrative location of the relevant programs, the forestry-specific and broader university curricula related to computational sciences, faculty expertise at the intersection of forestry and computation, the university's HPC infrastructure and access policies, strategic alignment at the university and college levels regarding these technologies, the surrounding research ecosystem including centers and partnerships, and the framework for AI ethics and responsible conduct of research.

**C. The Imperative of Computational Methods in Modern Forestry**

The field of forestry is increasingly reliant on sophisticated computational tools to address multifaceted challenges. Sustainable forest management, climate change impact assessment, wildfire modeling and prediction, precision forestry operations, biodiversity monitoring, and ecosystem service quantification demand the capacity to process, analyze, and model vast and complex datasets.3 Consequently, there is a growing need for forestry professionals equipped with skills in AI, ML, DS, and HPC to develop innovative solutions and effectively manage forest resources for the future.1 This report assesses the extent to which OSU's forestry programs are meeting this evolving demand.

## **II. Forestry Program Context**

**A. Administrative Home**

The primary administrative unit for forestry education and research at OSU is the College of Forestry.1 Within the College, academic programs are organized into three departments: Forest Engineering, Resources, and Management (FERM); Forest Ecosystems & Society (FES); and Wood Science & Engineering (WSE).1 The SAF-accredited Bachelor of Science (BS) degrees in Forestry and Forest Engineering are housed within the Department of Forest Engineering, Resources, and Management (FERM).16

**B. SAF Accreditation Status and Scope**

Oregon State University maintains SAF accreditation for its **BS in Forestry** and its **BS in Forest Engineering** programs. Both programs underwent their last SAF review in 2022 and hold accreditation through December 31, 2032\. The Forest Engineering program benefits from dual accreditation, also holding accreditation from the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET.1

SAF accreditation serves as a critical non-governmental, peer-review process ensuring the quality of postsecondary forestry education in the United States and Canada. It signifies that a degree program meets established standards of educational excellence, covering essential technical, professional, and interpersonal skills required for a successful forestry career. This accreditation is recognized by employers and licensing bodies, often simplifying the pathway to professional certification and employment. The dual SAF and ABET accreditation for the Forest Engineering program underscores a commitment to rigorous standards in both forestry science and engineering principles, suggesting a curriculum with significant quantitative and computational depth compared to programs solely accredited under forestry standards.

## **III. Curriculum Analysis: Computational Integration**

**A. Forestry-Specific Curriculum (Forestry BS & Forest Engineering BS)**

An examination of the required coursework for OSU's SAF-accredited Forestry and Forest Engineering undergraduate degrees reveals a curriculum built upon traditional quantitative and technological foundations relevant to the field.

1\. Foundational Quantitative Courses:  
The curricula mandate courses designed to build essential skills in measurement, analysis, and modeling using established forestry techniques. Key required courses include:

* **FOR 321 Forest Mensuration:** Covers methods for measuring tree, stand, and forest attributes, sampling techniques, and quantitative analysis of forest vegetation data to support management decisions.20  
* **FOR 322 Forest Models:** Introduces static and dynamic forest models, covering their definition, potential uses, and general development methodologies.20  
* **FE 208 Forest Surveying:** Focuses on the theory and practice of surveying methods and measurements applied to forestry problems.20  
* **FE 102 Forest Engineering Problem Solving and Technology:** Introduces the formulation and implementation of computational solutions (using spreadsheets and/or programming) for engineering analysis and design problems in forestry contexts.20  
* **FE 257 GIS and Forest Engineering Applications:** Provides an introduction to Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Global Positioning Systems (GPS), and remote sensing technologies, covering spatial database creation, analysis, and modeling for forest management and operational planning.20  
* **FE 440 Forest Operations Analysis:** Covers methods analysis, productivity measurement, and engineering economics related to harvesting systems.22  
* **FE 444 Forest Remote Sensing and Photogrammetry:** Introduces spectral reflectance, photogrammetry, image analysis, point clouds (including lidar), and radar applications in forestry.20  
* **FE 457/FOR 457 Techniques for Forest Resource Analysis:** Focuses on applying optimization techniques (linear, nonlinear, dynamic programming) and simulation to solve complex forest management problems, including multi-use scheduling and investment analysis.20

Additional foundational courses include statistics (ST 243Z or ST 351\) and calculus (MTH 111Z, 112Z, 241), establishing a necessary quantitative base for the upper-division coursework.20 The curriculum structure, particularly for Forest Engineering, integrates engineering principles with forestry knowledge.24

2\. Specific AI/ML/DS Courses within Forestry:  
Based on the available course descriptions for the core requirements of the Forestry and Forest Engineering majors 1, there are no dedicated courses explicitly focused on Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, or advanced Data Science techniques integrated as mandatory components. While courses like FE 102 involve computation, FE 257 and FE 444 cover GIS and remote sensing (which often utilize ML algorithms in practice), and FE 457 involves modeling and simulation, the core curriculum does not appear to mandate training in the development or application of modern AI/ML algorithms themselves. The emphasis remains on established quantitative methods, geospatial technologies, and operations research techniques applied to forestry.  
3\. Relevant Minors/Certificates within Forestry:  
The College of Forestry offers undergraduate minors in Forestry, Natural Resources, Wood Innovation for Sustainability, and Wood Product Sales.26 These minors provide specialization within broader forestry-related fields but do not appear to include options specifically focused on computational methods, AI, or data science housed entirely within the College.  
The analysis indicates that OSU's SAF-accredited forestry programs provide students with a robust foundation in traditional quantitative forestry disciplines, including biometrics (mensuration), modeling, GIS, and remote sensing. However, the core curriculum currently lacks dedicated, required coursework in advanced AI, ML, or big data analytics. Students aiming to acquire these cutting-edge computational skills must actively seek them through elective courses or programs offered elsewhere within the university.

**B. Broader OSU Computational Curriculum**

Beyond the College of Forestry, Oregon State University offers a rich and expanding landscape of programs and resources in advanced computation, AI, and data science, potentially accessible to forestry students.

1\. Overview of Relevant OSU Programs:  
OSU has established itself as a leader in computational fields through several key academic offerings:

* **Artificial Intelligence:** OSU was the first institution in the U.S. to offer both Master of Science (MS) and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degrees specifically in Artificial Intelligence, housed within the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS).28 An AI graduate minor is also available.30  
* **Data Science/Analytics:** The Department of Statistics offers an online MS in Data Analytics 32 and an online Graduate Certificate in Data Analytics.32 The College of Business provides a BS in Business Analytics with various options 40, an MBA concentration, and a Business Analytics minor and graduate certificate. OSU also supports a "Data Science @ OSU" initiative providing computational learning environments.41  
* **Geographic Information Science (GIScience):** OSU offers comprehensive training through an undergraduate GIScience Certificate, a graduate GIScience Certificate (available online) 42, and BS/MS/PhD programs in Geography and Geospatial Science within the College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences (CEOAS).8  
* **Computer Science (CS) / Electrical & Computer Engineering (ECE):** The School of EECS provides a wide array of relevant courses, including foundational AI (AI 531/CS 531), Machine Learning (AI 534/CS 534, CS 513), Deep Learning (AI 535), Computer Vision (AI 537/AI 637), Natural Language Processing (AI 538), Probabilistic Graphical Models (AI 536), Databases (CS 540), Bioinformatics (CS 546), Convex Optimization (ECE 599), and Signal Processing (ECE 565).28  
* **Statistics:** The Department of Statistics offers MS and PhD programs, a graduate minor, and an undergraduate minor.32 Relevant graduate courses include Data Analytics foundations (ST 516-518), Multivariate Analytics (ST 558), Time Series Analytics (ST 566), R Programming (ST 536), Data Visualization (ST 537), Methods for Large/Complex Data (ST 538), and Spatial Statistics (ST 567).32

2\. Accessibility for Forestry Students:  
Forestry students, as members of the OSU community, have the potential to access these broader computational offerings. They can enroll in relevant courses as electives, pursue minors (e.g., GIScience 61, Statistics 59), or obtain certificates (e.g., GIScience 61, Data Analytics 37). The availability of many programs and certificates via OSU Ecampus enhances flexibility and accessibility.32  
However, significant prerequisites exist for many advanced computational courses. For instance, AI 534 (Machine Learning) and AI 535 (Deep Learning) assume proficiency in programming, statistics, calculus, and linear algebra.52 Similarly, upper-level GIScience courses often require foundational GIS, statistics, or programming knowledge.60 While the Forestry and Forest Engineering curricula provide some foundation (e.g., calculus, basic statistics, FE 102 programming, FE 257 GIS 20), they may not automatically fulfill all prerequisites for advanced AI, ML, or Data Science courses in EECS or Statistics. Therefore, forestry students interested in deep computational specialization must plan their coursework carefully, potentially taking additional foundational courses, which could impact their time to graduation.

3\. Data Science @ OSU Initiative:  
To facilitate broader engagement with data science tools and methods, OSU has implemented the "Data Science @ OSU" (DS @ OSU) initiative.41 Managed by Advanced Research Computing Services (ARCS), this platform provides students and instructors with access to powerful, cloud-based computational environments through a web browser, often integrated directly into Canvas course shells.41 It supports over 40 programming languages, including Python, R, and Julia, along with interfaces like JupyterLab and RStudio, and a wide array of pre-installed packages.41 This initiative aims to make interactive data science learning more accessible, repeatable, and shareable, reducing dependence on specific computer lab hardware and potentially lowering the barrier for incorporating data science exercises into courses across various disciplines, including forestry.41  
In summary, while OSU's core forestry curricula focus on traditional quantitative skills, the university provides a rich and diverse ecosystem of advanced computational programs and courses. Forestry students can access these opportunities, but doing so effectively requires proactive academic planning to navigate prerequisites. The DS @ OSU platform represents a valuable university-wide resource that could be further leveraged to integrate practical data science skills within the College of Forestry's existing courses.

## **IV. Faculty Expertise at the Intersection**

This concentration of expertise across multiple colleges presents a significant asset for OSU. Interdisciplinary centers like AgAID, CoRIS, and CQLS, along with faculty holding joint appointments, provide formal mechanisms for collaboration. However, effectively leveraging this distributed expertise for forestry students and researchers likely requires structured guidance, clear inter-program pathways, and proactive facilitation to bridge departmental boundaries and ensure prerequisite alignment for cross-disciplinary coursework or research.

## **V. High-Performance Computing Ecosystem for Forestry**

OSU provides a diverse but somewhat decentralized High-Performance Computing (HPC) environment available to its research community, including faculty and students in the College of Forestry. Understanding the different resources, access policies, and capabilities is crucial for leveraging computation effectively.

**A. Overview of OSU's HPC Landscape**

Instead of a single, centralized HPC center, OSU's research computing infrastructure comprises several key entities:

* **Advanced Research Computing Services (ARCS):** ARCS (formerly Digital Research Infrastructure) serves as a primary support unit for research and instructional computing across OSU. It manages the **Novus cluster**, the main shared HPC resource, which utilizes the SLURM workload manager.65 ARCS also provides consultation services, storage solutions, and the cloud-based Data Science @ OSU platform.41  
* **College of Engineering (COE) HPC Cluster:** The COE maintains a significant, heterogeneous cluster featuring over 130 servers, approximately 4,700 CPU cores, over 200 GPUs, and substantial RAM and storage.123 This cluster includes high-end Nvidia DGX systems (H100, V100) and various Dell nodes with diverse CPU and GPU configurations, connected via Infiniband.123 It also uses the SLURM scheduler.124 While primarily for engineering users, access is possible for researchers from other colleges, like Forestry, with faculty sponsorship.124  
* **Forestry Computing Resources (FCR):** The College of Forestry operates its own IT support group (FCR) which manages computing facilities including Windows/UNIX networks, web/database servers, over 130TB of file storage, enterprise backups, and **two private Linux compute clusters** totaling 558 processors.125 These resources primarily serve College of Forestry members and approved collaborators.130 FCR policies are extensions of the main university acceptable use policies.128  
* **Center for Quantitative Life Sciences (CQLS):** Focused on life and environmental sciences, CQLS provides extensive computational resources, including an HPC cluster with over 6,000 processors, 8.5 PB of shared disk space, GPU compute capabilities, and bioinformatics support.117 Access is available to OSU researchers, though costs may be associated depending on departmental arrangements or direct investment (condo model).133 CQLS also runs the Advanced Cyberinfrastructure Teaching Facility (ACTF) for instructional purposes.137  
* **Future: Jen-Hsun Huang and Lori Mills Huang Collaborative Innovation Complex (HCIC):** Scheduled to open in 2026, this complex will house a state-of-the-art NVIDIA supercomputer (using the next-generation "Rubin" chipset), significantly boosting OSU's capabilities in AI and research computing across disciplines including climate science and biological modeling.28 This represents a major future investment and potential centralization of high-end computing resources.

**B. GPU Resources**

Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are critical for accelerating AI, ML, and complex modeling tasks. OSU offers GPU resources across several clusters:

* **COE Cluster:** Possesses the most extensive and varied GPU resources detailed in the provided materials, including high-end NVIDIA H100 (in DGXH nodes), V100 (in DGX2 and DGXS nodes), A40, RTX 8000, RTX 6000, and T4 GPUs.123 These are accessible via Slurm job requests.124  
* **ARCS Novus / Federated Resources:** The Novus cluster itself has dedicated GPU partitions (gpu.q, preempt-gpu.q).122 While specific Novus GPU types aren't listed in the primary ARCS snippets, the training materials offered through ARCS cover ML/DL and containerized AI workflows, suggesting suitable hardware exists.143 Furthermore, CQLS resources, including V100 GPUs 136, are part of the federated campus HPC environment accessible via ARCS 132, likely contributing to the GPU capacity available through Novus queues.  
* **CQLS Cluster:** Explicitly supports AI/ML data science using GPU processing.118 Their infrastructure includes nodes equipped with NVIDIA V100 GPUs.136 The instructional ACTF cluster also contains GPU resources.137  
* **FCR Clusters:** The description mentions two Linux clusters with 558 processors but does not specify if they include GPUs.126

**C. Access Policies & Costs**

Accessing OSU's HPC resources involves navigating different policies and potential costs depending on the specific cluster and user affiliation:

* **ARCS Novus:** Offers tiered access.121 The **Standard** tier is free for all OSU students and researchers, providing access to 10 shared general compute nodes and a 100GB home directory storage quota. The **Shared** tier allows access to PI-owned nodes when idle, but jobs are preemptible. The **Condo** model allows PIs/groups to purchase dedicated nodes integrated into the cluster, guaranteeing priority access while allowing shared use when idle; ARCS manages these nodes for 5 years at no additional administrative cost. Scratch storage is available but temporary (90-day purge).121 Access requires an ONID account.122 Publications using ARCS resources require acknowledgment.121  
* **COE Cluster:** Primarily for COE faculty and students. However, **non-COE researchers (e.g., from Forestry) can gain access** but require sponsorship from a faculty member in their home department/college, must submit a specific webform request, and are required to attend a mandatory introductory training session.124 Access uses ONID credentials.124  
* **FCR:** Access is generally restricted to College of Forestry faculty, staff, students, and specifically approved collaborators or partners.130 Policies govern the use of non-OSU owned machines on the network.130 While base services are likely covered for CoF members, specific fees may apply for extended services or resources, though details are not provided in the snippets.128 Login uses FORESTRY or ONID accounts.128  
* **CQLS:** Resources are available to OSU researchers, but access may involve costs depending on arrangements between CQLS and the researcher's home college/department, or through direct investment (potentially via a condo-like model, suggested by the monthly maintenance fees mentioned for dedicated machines).133 General access is likely available through the all.q queue.132 An account request process is required.135  
* **University-Wide Policy:** All users must adhere to OSU's Acceptable Use of Computing Resources policy.131 This policy prohibits sharing account credentials, attempting to circumvent security, degrading system performance, and requires compliance with laws and licenses. It permits minimal personal use under strict conditions and states no expectation of privacy for data on university systems.131

**D. OSU HPC Resources Summary Table**

| Resource/Cluster | Managing Unit | Key CPU Specs (Examples) | Key GPU Specs (Examples) | Interconnect (Primary) | Scheduler | Primary Access Models | Default Storage Quota | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Novus Cluster** | ARCS | General compute nodes (details not specified) | GPU nodes available (types not specified, likely includes federated CQLS resources) | Not specified | SLURM | Standard (Free), Shared (Preemptible), Condo (PI Purchase) | 100 GB Home | Main shared resource for OSU. Data Science @ OSU platform access. Scratch purged after 90 days. 121 |
| **COE Cluster** | COE IT | Intel Xeon (Skylake, Cascadelake), AMD EPYC (various gens) | NVIDIA H100, V100, A40, RTX 8000, RTX 6000, T4 | Infiniband (EDR/HDR) | SLURM | COE users; Non-COE users require sponsorship \+ training | Not specified | Heterogeneous, \>200 GPUs. Includes DGX systems. 123 |
| **FCR Clusters (2)** | Forestry (FCR) | Linux Clusters (558 processors total, types not specified) | Not specified | Not specified | Not specified | CoF faculty, staff, students; Approved collaborators | \>130 TB total shared | Primarily for CoF use. Specific cluster details limited. 126 |
| **CQLS Cluster** | CQLS | \>6000 processors (includes AMD EPYC, IBM POWER9) | NVIDIA V100 (others likely) | 10/40/100 GbE, Infiniband? | SGE (implied) | OSU Researchers; Costs may apply; Priority queues available | 75 GB Free (more avail) | Focus on life/environmental sciences, bioinformatics. \>8.5 PB storage. Federated with campus HPC. 119 |
| **HCIC Supercomputer** | University | NVIDIA "Grace" CPU (Next-gen) | NVIDIA "Rubin" GPU (Next-gen) | NVIDIA Networking | Not specified | Future resource (opening 2026\) | Not applicable | Major future upgrade, focus on AI, climate science, etc. 138 |

This decentralized structure offers flexibility and specialized resources (like those in COE and CQLS) but requires researchers, particularly those outside the host college (like Forestry faculty needing COE resources), to understand different access procedures, potential costs, and varying hardware/software environments. The condo model provides a consistent mechanism across some units (ARCS, potentially CQLS) for securing dedicated resources. The forthcoming HCIC supercomputer promises a significant leap in centralized capability.

## **VI. Strategic University and College Directions**

OSU's commitment to integrating advanced computation, data science, and AI is evident in its university-wide strategic planning and targeted initiatives, creating a supportive environment for the College of Forestry to leverage these technologies.

**C. College of Forestry Strategic Plan (2023-2027)**

The College of Forestry's strategic plan focuses on three primary goals: Inclusive, Experiential and Impactful Academics; Transformational Research and Scholarship; and Community-Focused Outreach and Engagement.5 While the high-level goals do not explicitly mention AI, data science, or HPC 5, the underlying objectives strongly imply their necessity.

* **Goal 1 (Academics):** Aims to prepare students to address present and future challenges concerning sustainability and global change, requiring curriculum development that integrates disciplines and prepares students for interdisciplinary solutions.5 Modern solutions increasingly involve computational approaches.  
* **Goal 2 (Research):** Focuses on strengthening research centers and advancing knowledge to co-create sustainable and equitable solutions for complex issues facing forest landscapes, ecosystems, and societies.5 Tackling these complex issues at scale inherently requires advanced modeling, data analysis, and potentially AI/ML techniques.  
* **Goal 3 (Outreach):** Emphasizes imparting critical knowledge and promoting stewardship 5, which can be enhanced by data-driven insights and decision-support tools developed through computation.

The plan was developed through a consultative process 158 and aligns with the broader university mission.158 The College's ability to achieve its goals for transformational research and impactful solutions for complex environmental problems is intrinsically linked to its capacity to leverage the advanced computational tools and expertise being prioritized at the university level.

**D. College of Engineering Strategic Plan (2020-2025)**

The College of Engineering's plan explicitly aligns with the university's direction, identifying **artificial intelligence, robotics, and computing** as signature research areas for investment.159 It includes objectives to accelerate investments in computing and invest in computing infrastructure, directly supporting the university's broader computational goals.159 This provides a strong collaborative partner for the College of Forestry in developing and applying computational tools.

**E. College of Science Strategic Plan (2022-2027)**

The College of Science identifies **Quantitative, computational and data sciences** as a signature area of strength and focus for research and innovation.2 This builds upon previous strategic goals (2015-2020) that aimed to establish leadership in data science and mathematical modeling, including developing educational programs like the online MS in Data Analytics.162 The College actively promotes transdisciplinary research through initiatives like the SciRIS seed grant program 162, fostering collaborations relevant to data-intensive environmental science.

Collectively, these strategic documents demonstrate a powerful, multi-level commitment at OSU to advancing AI, data science, and research computing. This top-down strategic direction from the university, coupled with explicit commitments from key partner colleges like Engineering and Science, creates a highly favorable environment for the College of Forestry. While the CoF's own plan focuses more on forestry-specific outcomes, achieving these outcomes in the modern era necessitates embracing the computational tools and interdisciplinary collaborations championed by the broader university strategy. The success of computational forestry at OSU will depend significantly on the College's ability to effectively connect with and leverage these university-wide initiatives and resources.

## **VIII. AI Ethics and Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR)**

As OSU increasingly incorporates AI and advanced computation into its research and teaching, establishing clear ethical guidelines and robust training in responsible conduct is paramount.

**A. OSU's Framework for AI Ethics**

OSU is actively developing its institutional approach to AI ethics, primarily through the **AI@OSU initiative** launched in late 2023\.148 This initiative, guided by an Advisory Group, aims to create an action plan encompassing standards, policies, and practices for AI use across education, research, and operations.153 Key areas of focus include quality, ethics, bias, discrimination, accessibility, equity, privacy, security, workforce implications, and legal considerations.153 The university emphasizes the need for **responsible, transparent, and ethical AI systems**.148

In the interim and as guidance evolves, several units provide resources:

* **Teaching and Learning:** OSU Ecampus and the Center for Teaching and Learning (CTL) offer significant guidance for instructors.181 Key recommendations include:  
  * **Clear Syllabus Policies:** Explicitly state whether and how generative AI tools (like ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot) can be used for assignments, linking policies to disciplinary standards if possible.181 OSU provides sample statements for restrictive, limited, or permissive use.182  
  * **Transparency and Accountability:** Emphasize human accountability for all submitted work, regardless of AI use.181 Require proper attribution if AI-generated text is used.182  
  * **Awareness of Limitations:** Educate students about AI's potential for inaccuracy, bias, fabrication of information/citations, and plagiarism.  
  * **Assignment Redesign:** Focus assessments on higher-order thinking, creativity, problem-solving, personal reflection, and integration of course-specific content rather than tasks easily completed by AI.182  
  * **AI Detection Tools:** Discourage reliance on AI detection software due to known issues with accuracy and bias.183  
  * **Privacy and Security:** Use university-vetted tools (like OSU's data-protected Microsoft Copilot 183) and discuss privacy risks with students.  
* **Research:** The Office of Research Integrity (ORI) is the primary resource.187 Guidance highlights:  
  * **Funder Policies:** Adherence to NIH and NSF policies regarding AI, including the prohibition of generative AI in peer review due to confidentiality breaches.192  
  * **Data Security:** Protecting confidential, proprietary, or sensitive data by not inputting it into non-secure AI tools.181  
  * **Ethical Principles:** Alignment with broadly recognized AI ethics principles such as transparency, justice/fairness, non-maleficence, responsibility/accountability, and privacy.193

**B. Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) Training**

OSU mandates RCR training for researchers supported by major federal agencies (NIH, NSF, USDA/NIFA).189

* **Content:** Training covers core research integrity topics like authorship, data management, conflicts of interest, peer review, misconduct, mentorship, and research involving human or animal subjects.188  
* **Format and Duration:** Requirements vary by agency. NIH mandates 8 hours of discussion-based, face-to-face instruction (interactive videoconferencing may partially fulfill this).194 NSF and USDA/NIFA requirements can often be met via online modules (e.g., CITI).189 OSU offers a comprehensive 9-month, in-person RCR training program suitable for meeting NIH requirements.190  
* **Frequency:** NIH requires training at each career stage or every 4 years; NSF also requires training every 4 years; USDA/NIFA training is required once per OSU policy.194  
* **AI Relevance:** Recent updates to NIH and NSF guidelines (2022-2023) explicitly incorporate topics highly relevant to AI ethics.192 These include secure and ethical data use, data confidentiality, management, sharing, ownership, research security, mentor training, and fostering safe and inclusive research environments.192 OSU's RCR resources page now links to AI ethics materials 192, indicating an effort to integrate these considerations into standard RCR training.

**C. Integration within College of Forestry**

The available documentation does not detail specific AI ethics curricula or guidelines developed uniquely *by* the College of Forestry. It is probable that the College relies on the university-level policies, central training resources (CITI, ORI workshops, CTL/Ecampus guidance), and the general RCR framework. Core forestry courses, such as Forest Policy (FOR 463\) 20, likely incorporate professional ethics relevant to the discipline, but may not yet systematically address the novel ethical challenges posed by AI in forest monitoring (e.g., data privacy with remote sensing), modeling (e.g., algorithmic bias in resource allocation models), or management (e.g., accountability for AI-driven decisions). Faculty involved in geospatial research (Wing, Kennedy, Van Den Hoek) or AI applications (Strimbu, Bolte) are likely grappling with these issues within their specific projects.7 OSU does offer relevant coursework outside Forestry, such as PHL 546: Social and Ethical Issues in Artificial Intelligence 31, which could be utilized by forestry students.

Overall, OSU is establishing a university-wide structure for AI ethics and governance through the AI@OSU initiative and integrating relevant concepts into RCR training. This provides a necessary foundation. However, the specific nuances of AI ethics in forestry and natural resource management (e.g., balancing conservation goals with data privacy, ensuring equity in AI-driven resource access, validating complex ecological models) represent an area where the College of Forestry could further develop domain-specific guidance and educational modules, leveraging the available university resources and expertise.

## **IX. Synthesis and Conclusion**

**A. Summary of Findings**

Oregon State University presents a compelling environment for the integration of advanced computation into forestry. The College of Forestry maintains highly-regarded, SAF-accredited programs in Forestry and Forest Engineering, providing students with strong traditional quantitative skills in areas like mensuration, modeling, GIS, and remote sensing.1 Concurrently, OSU demonstrates significant institutional commitment to becoming a leader in Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, and High-Performance Computing, evidenced by its university-wide strategic plan ("Prosperity Widely Shared"), the dedicated AI@OSU initiative, substantial investments in HPC infrastructure (including the upcoming HCIC supercomputer), and robust academic programs in EECS, Statistics, Data Analytics, and GIScience.2 A rich research ecosystem exists, featuring interdisciplinary centers (INR, TDI, CQLS, CoRIS) and faculty expertise spanning computational ecology, geospatial analysis, ML, and modeling, with active projects and strong agency/industry partnerships.7 Furthermore, OSU is proactively developing frameworks for AI ethics and responsible conduct of research training.148
