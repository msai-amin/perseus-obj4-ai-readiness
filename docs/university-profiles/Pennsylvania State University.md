# **Penn State's Forestry Program: An Institutional Capability Analysis**

## **Introduction**

**Purpose**

This report provides a comprehensive assessment of Pennsylvania State University's (Penn State) institutional capabilities for integrating advanced computational methods, including Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Data Science, and High-Performance Computing (HPC), into its Society of American Foresters (SAF)-accredited forestry program. The analysis examines the program's structure, curriculum, faculty expertise within the host department and affiliated units, central computational resources, institutional strategic direction, and the prevailing ethical framework governing AI and research conduct.

**Scope and Methodology**

The scope encompasses an evaluation of Penn State's undergraduate forestry education (primarily the B.S. in Forest Ecosystem Management), relevant minors and certificates, advanced coursework opportunities in computational fields across the university, faculty research profiles pertinent to quantitative forestry and AI/ML/Data Science, the specifications and accessibility of the ICDS Roar supercomputing facility, university and college-level strategic plans, and policies related to AI ethics and responsible conduct of research. The methodology involved analyzing publicly available information from Penn State websites, university bulletins, course catalogs, faculty directories, strategic planning documents, institutional policies, and specifically provided research data.

**Context**

Modern forestry and natural resource management face increasingly complex challenges, driven by factors such as climate change, biodiversity loss, sustainable resource demands, and the need for precise ecosystem monitoring. Addressing these challenges effectively requires professionals equipped not only with traditional ecological knowledge but also with advanced quantitative skills. Data science, AI, ML, and computational modeling offer powerful tools for analyzing large datasets (e.g., from remote sensing, sensor networks, genetic sequencing), developing predictive models for ecosystem dynamics, optimizing management strategies, and enhancing decision-making under uncertainty. Evaluating Penn State's capacity to integrate these cutting-edge technologies into its forestry training is therefore crucial for understanding its ability to prepare graduates for the future of the profession.

## **Penn State's SAF-Accredited Forestry Program: Identification and Structure**

**2.1 College and Department**

The primary administrative home for Penn State's main SAF-accredited Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree program in forestry is the **Department of Ecosystem Science and Management (ESM)**. This department is situated within the **College of Agricultural Sciences** at the University Park campus.1 The ESM department's mission encompasses preparing students for careers focused on the conservation and management of both natural and human-dominated ecosystems. Its scope includes fisheries, wildlife, soils, forests, water resources, agriculture, and agroecosystems, aiming to develop leaders capable of addressing critical resource management challenges.1

**2.2 SAF Accreditation**

Penn State offers forestry programs accredited by the Society of American Foresters (SAF), a key indicator of program quality and adherence to professional standards.4 SAF accreditation signifies that a degree program meets the standards of educational excellence established by the forestry profession, assuring a level of quality rather than providing a ranking.5 Penn State has a long history with SAF accreditation, being among the initial cohort of forestry programs accredited in 1935\.4

The university provides two distinct SAF-accredited forestry pathways:

1. **B.S. in Forest Ecosystem Management (University Park):** This four-year degree, housed in the ESM department, provides the comprehensive education necessary for students pursuing professional careers in various forestry and natural resource fields.1  
2. **Associate in Science (A.S.) in Forest Technology (Penn State Mont Alto):** This two-year associate degree program, also SAF-accredited, focuses on training field technicians with practical skills in forest management, tree care, and wildlife management.1 It emphasizes hands-on experience, with significant time spent in nearby forests.8

A notable feature is the "2+2 Plan," which allows graduates from the Mont Alto Forest Technology A.S. program to seamlessly transition into the B.S. in Forest Ecosystem Management program at University Park, typically completing the bachelor's degree within a total of four years.8 This structure provides flexibility, catering to students seeking technician roles as well as those aiming for professional forestry careers, and offers an accessible pathway for students starting at a Commonwealth campus.

It is important to distinguish Penn State's programs from the similarly named A.A.S. in Forest Technology offered by the Pennsylvania College of Technology (Penn College), which is also SAF-accredited but represents a separate institution.1

**2.3 Program Options (B.S. Forest Ecosystem Management)**

The B.S. in Forest Ecosystem Management major allows students to specialize their studies through one of four distinct options 2:

* **Forest Biology:** Focuses on the biological and ecological aspects of forestry, providing a foundation for employment or graduate studies in forest and environmental sciences.6  
* **Forest Management:** Offers professional training in managing forest lands according to ownership objectives, preparing graduates for roles in public agencies, industry, or consulting.6  
* **Community and Urban Forest Management:** Prepares students to manage trees and green spaces in community settings, emphasizing technical expertise and communication skills for working with diverse stakeholders.6  
* **Watershed Management:** Concentrates on water resources and the integrated management of natural resources with an emphasis on water, qualifying graduates for roles as hydrologists or in water-related careers.6

These options enable students to align their coursework more closely with specific career aspirations within the broader field of forestry and natural resource management.

The forestry program at Penn State boasts a rich history, originating in 1907 and later incorporating the Pennsylvania State Forest Academy from Mont Alto in 1929\.15 This long-standing institutional commitment suggests a well-established program, likely with strong traditions and alumni connections. However, the evolution from early 20th-century field practices 15 to the demands of modern, computationally-driven forestry highlights the ongoing need for curriculum adaptation to incorporate contemporary tools and techniques.

## **Curriculum Analysis: Forest Ecosystem Management (B.S.)**

The curriculum for the B.S. in Forest Ecosystem Management provides a foundation in forestry principles, ecological science, and management practices, with varying levels of quantitative and computational training embedded within the core requirements and specific options.

**Core Requirements (All Options)**

Several courses required for all students in the Forest Ecosystem Management major introduce foundational quantitative and spatial analysis skills:

* **Quantification:** Students must complete an introductory statistics course, choosing from STAT 200 (Elementary Statistics), STAT 240 (Introduction to Biometry), or STAT 250 (Introduction to Biostatistics).2 This ensures a baseline understanding of statistical concepts and methods.  
* **Spatial Tools & Measurements:** FOR 255 (GPS and GIS Applications for Natural Resources Professionals) introduces fundamental spatial technologies.6 FOR 266 (Forest Resources Measurements) covers methods for quantifying forest attributes.6 These courses provide essential skills for collecting and handling spatial forestry data.  
* **Ecology & Foundational Science:** FOR 308 (Forest Ecology) 6, SOILS 101 (Introductory Soil Science) 6, CHEM 110/111 (Chemical Principles/Experimental Chemistry) 2, and an introductory economics course (AGBM 101, ECON 102, or ECON 104\) 2 provide the scientific context.  
* **Communication:** Technical writing (ENGL 202C or 202D) and effective speech (CAS 100\) are required, equipping students to communicate technical findings.2

**Option-Specific Courses and Quantitative Focus**

The integration of more advanced quantitative and computational coursework varies by option:

* **Forest Management Option:** This option appears to have the most integrated requirements for advanced spatial and data analysis tools. Key required courses include:  
  * FOR 350: Forest Ecosystem Monitoring and Data Analysis 16  
  * FOR 455: Remote Sensing and Spatial Data Handling 16  
  * FOR 466W: Forest Management and Planning 16 These courses suggest training in analyzing monitoring data, processing remote sensing imagery, and potentially using planning models (which often involve optimization or simulation). Other required courses like FOR 440 (Forest and Conservation Economics) and FOR 470 (Watershed Management) also likely involve quantitative analysis.6  
* **Forest Biology Option:** This option requires FOR 350 (Forest Ecosystem Monitoring and Data Analysis) 16 and mandates MATH 110 (Techniques of Calculus I) 17, providing a stronger mathematical foundation than other options might require. It includes ecology courses like BIOL 220W (Biology: Populations and Communities) 16 and FOR 430 (Conservation Biology) 16, which often involve quantitative approaches, but the prescribed curriculum seems less focused on specific *computational tools* (like advanced GIS/remote sensing or programming) compared to the Forest Management option.16  
* **Community and Urban Forest Management Option:** Requires FOR 255 and FOR 266\. Students must select one course from FOR 455 (Remote Sensing), GEOG 363 (GIS), or SOILS 450 (Environmental GIS), ensuring exposure to intermediate or advanced spatial analysis techniques.18 It also includes specialized courses like HORT 301 (Arboriculture) and PLANT 217 (Landscape Soil & Water Mgmt).18  
* **Watershed Management Option:** Requires FOR 470 (Watershed Management) and GEOG 430 (Human Use of Environment).16 This option likely involves significant use of spatial data and potentially hydrological modeling, but the required course list doesn't explicitly mandate advanced computational modeling or programming courses beyond the core statistics and introductory GIS.

Across all options, the core curriculum establishes a necessary foundation in basic statistics and introductory GIS/GPS applications. However, the integration of more advanced computational methods, such as programming beyond standard GIS software workflows, machine learning, AI techniques, or sophisticated simulation modeling, is not universally mandated. Such advanced training appears concentrated in specific upper-level courses, particularly within the Forest Management option (e.g., FOR 455, FOR 466W), or must be pursued through electives or complementary minors/certificates. Students desiring deep computational expertise will need to look beyond the standard requirements of most options.

**Relevant Electives, Minors, and Certificates**

While the core requirements provide a certain level of quantitative training, students can deepen their computational and data analysis skills through electives and formal programs outside the major requirements.

* **Electives within ESM:** The provided materials focus heavily on required courses, making it difficult to ascertain the full range of relevant computational electives offered directly by the ESM department beyond courses like FOR 455 or FOR 350 when not required by a specific option.  
* **Geographic Information Science (GIS) Pathways:** Penn State offers well-defined pathways for students to specialize in GIS through programs administered by the Department of Geography in the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences (EMS).  
  * **GIS Minor:** This 18-credit minor requires introductory GIS (GEOG 160 or 260), intermediate courses (choice of Cartography, Remote Sensing, GIS, GIS Programming), 6 credits of 400-level GIScience (which can include FOR 455, GEOG 462-467, SOILS 450, etc.), and 3 additional GIScience credits (potentially including FOR 255).19 The structure allows forestry students, particularly those taking FOR 455, to integrate these requirements relatively efficiently.20  
  * **GIS Undergraduate Certificate:** A 12-credit option requiring GEOG 260 and 9 credits from a list of intermediate and advanced GIScience courses, again including options like FOR 455 and SOILS 450\.23 This provides a shorter, focused credential in GIS tools and techniques.23  
  * **GIS Postbaccalaureate Certificate (Online):** For students seeking GIS skills after their bachelor's degree, or potentially as supplemental learning, this 12-credit online certificate focuses on hands-on experience with modern mapping tools (GEOG 482, 483, 484 for novices) and can serve as a pathway to online Master's degrees.26  
* **Other Potential Minors/Certificates:** The university also offers minors or certificates in related areas like Environmental Soil Science 2, Community Forestry 2, Geospatial Big Data Analytics 25, and Landscape Ecology 25, which might offer complementary skills, though details are limited in the provided information. A Data Visualization minor exists but appears tied to the Behrend campus.27

The availability and structure of the GIS Minor and Certificate programs demonstrate a clear and accessible route for Forest Ecosystem Management students to gain substantial expertise in geospatial technologies.20 The inclusion of forestry-specific courses like FOR 455 within these programs facilitates this integration.20

However, pathways for integrating more advanced Data Science, AI, or ML *specifically* appear less defined within the standard Forest Ecosystem Management curriculum itself. While GIS is well-integrated, students seeking expertise in programming for data analysis (e.g., Python, R beyond introductory statistics), machine learning algorithms, or AI applications would need to proactively pursue these through electives or minors offered by other departments, such as Information Sciences and Technology (IST), Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), or Statistics (STAT). The forestry curriculum focuses primarily on applying existing tools (GPS, GIS, basic stats, remote sensing software) to forestry problems, rather than on the development or advanced application of computational algorithms or AI/ML models.

**Table 3.1: Key Quantitative/Computational Courses in B.S. Forest Ecosystem Management Options**

| Option | Required Course Code | Course Title | Brief Description (Quantitative/Computational Focus) | Credits |

## **Advanced Coursework in AI, ML, HPC, and Data Analytics (Beyond ESM)**

Students in Forest Ecosystem Management seeking advanced training in AI, ML, HPC, or data analytics beyond the departmental requirements must typically look to courses offered by other colleges and departments, primarily the College of Information Sciences and Technology (IST), the College of Engineering (specifically Computer Science and Engineering \- CSE), and the Department of Statistics within the Eberly College of Science.

**College of Information Sciences and Technology (IST)**

IST offers several degree programs focused on information, technology, and data, providing a rich source of relevant coursework.28

* **Relevant Programs:** The B.S. in Data Sciences, particularly the **Applied Data Sciences option** housed within IST, is highly relevant.28 Other potentially relevant majors include Cybersecurity Analytics and Operations, and Information Sciences and Technology.28  
* **Data Science Major (Applied Option):** This option requires a core set of Data Science (DS) courses covering fundamentals like privacy/security (DS 300), algorithms (DS 305), machine learning (DS 310), data integration (DS 320), visual analytics (DS 330), and big data programming (DS/CMPSC 410).32 It also requires 12 credits in an application focus area (e.g., Business, Economics, Psychology, or a custom focus approved by an advisor) and electives such as DS 442 (Artificial Intelligence).31  
* **Potential Elective Courses:** Beyond the DS major courses, IST offers foundational courses in programming (IST 140, IST 240, IST 242, IST 256), data organization (IST 210), networking (IST 220), and potentially special topics in emerging technologies (IST 402\) that could include AI/ML.33

**College of Engineering (Computer Science and Engineering \- CSE)**

CSE provides rigorous training in the theoretical and practical aspects of computing, including algorithms, systems, and AI/ML.

* **Relevant Programs:** CSE offers the **Computational Data Sciences option** within the B.S. in Data Sciences.29 It also offers M.S., M.Eng., and Ph.D. degrees in CSE.34  
* **Relevant Undergraduate Courses:** Key courses include CMPSC 442 (Artificial Intelligence) 32, CMPSC 448 (Machine Learning and Algorithmic AI) 32, and foundational courses like CMPSC 465 (Data Structures and Algorithms).34 CMPSC 448 introduces ML concepts (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement learning) and assumes proficiency in Python, calculus, probability, and statistics.36  
* **Relevant Graduate Courses:** CSE offers advanced courses such as CSE 511 (Operating Systems), CSE 513 (Distributed Systems), CSE 530 (Computer Architecture), CSE 565 (Algorithm Design), CSE 583 (Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning) 38, CSE 584 (Machine Learning: Tools and Algorithms) 39, CSE 586 (Computer Vision), and CSE 587 (Deep Learning for NLP).39 CSE 583 covers pattern recognition principles 40, while CSE 584 focuses on computational methods for modern ML models and big data applications.40

**Department of Statistics (Eberly College of Science)**

The Statistics department provides theoretical and applied training in statistical modeling, analysis, and computation.

* **Relevant Programs:** Offers a B.S. in Statistics with various options 35 and the **Statistical Modeling Data Sciences option**.29 Online programs include a Master of Applied Statistics (M.A.S.) and a Graduate Certificate in Applied Statistics.45  
* **Relevant Undergraduate Courses:** Foundational courses include STAT 414 (Introduction to Probability Theory) and STAT 415 (Introduction to Mathematical Statistics).35 Applied courses include STAT 440 (Computational Statistics) 32, STAT 463 (Applied Time Series Analysis), STAT 464 (Applied Nonparametric Statistics), and programming courses like STAT 184 (Intro to R), STAT 480-483 (SAS), STAT 484/485 (R), and STAT 487 (Intro Statistical Analysis with Python).35  
* **Relevant Graduate Courses:** Many are offered online via World Campus. Key courses include STAT 500 (Applied Statistics), STAT 501 (Regression Methods), STAT 502 (Analysis of Variance and Design of Experiments), STAT 505 (Applied Multivariate Statistical Analysis), and notably STAT 508 (Applied Data Mining & Statistical Learning).45 STAT 508 covers a wide range of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques (regression, classification, PCA, clustering, SVMs, trees) using R.47

**Accessibility and Prerequisites Analysis**

While numerous advanced courses exist, accessing them poses a significant challenge for typical Forest Ecosystem Management undergraduates. A major hurdle lies in the prerequisite requirements.

* **Mathematical Prerequisites:** Many advanced computational courses in CSE, IST (Data Science), and Statistics require a calculus sequence (MATH 140, MATH 141), linear algebra (MATH 220), and sometimes vector analysis (MATH 230).31 The standard forestry curriculum generally only requires introductory statistics (STAT 200/240/250).2 Only the Forest Biology option explicitly requires MATH 110 (Calculus I).17 This mathematical gap prevents direct entry into many intermediate and advanced computational courses.  
* **Computer Science Prerequisites:** Courses like CMPSC 448 (ML) and upper-level DS courses often require foundational programming and data structures courses (e.g., CMPSC 121/131, CMPSC 122/132).31 These are not part of the standard forestry curriculum.  
* **Graduate Course Access:** Enrolling in 500-level courses typically requires graduate standing or specific undergraduate preparation and instructor permission.49 While courses like STAT 508 (Applied Data Mining) 47 or CSE 583/584 40 offer relevant content, they are designed for students with a stronger quantitative or computational background than usually provided by the B.S. in Forestry.

Consequently, forestry undergraduates aiming for deep expertise in AI, ML, or advanced data science must undertake substantial proactive planning. This likely involves strategically using elective credits to fulfill prerequisites, potentially extending their time to degree, or pursuing a minor (e.g., Data Science, GIS with a programming focus, Statistics) or even a double major, although the latter presents significant logistical challenges due to disparate degree requirements.

The B.S. in Data Sciences 28, particularly the Applied Data Sciences option offered by IST 31, provides a structured curriculum in relevant methods. However, pursuing this as a double major with Forestry appears difficult given the distinct core requirements and prerequisites for each program. While the Data Science major allows for an "application focus area," including the possibility of a custom focus 31, this 12-credit component 32 cannot substitute for the extensive, specialized coursework required for the SAF-accredited Forest Ecosystem Management degree. A custom focus might offer a bridge, but its feasibility depends heavily on advisor guidance and course availability.

## **Faculty Expertise in AI/ML, Geospatial Analysis, and Quantitative Modeling**

The capacity of Penn State's forestry program to integrate advanced computation and data science is significantly influenced by the expertise of its faculty, both within the Department of Ecosystem Science and Management (ESM) and in affiliated departments and institutes across the university.

**Faculty within Ecosystem Science and Management (ESM)**

The ESM department possesses considerable internal strength in quantitative ecology, modeling, and spatial analysis applied directly to forest and wildlife systems. Key faculty include:

* **Frances Buderman (Assistant Professor, Quantitative Wildlife Ecology):** Specializes in the development and application of novel statistical methods, particularly Bayesian statistics and hierarchical modeling, to understand wildlife demography, movement, and space-use. Her research utilizes integrated modeling frameworks, time-to-event analysis, and change-point models to analyze complex ecological data.52 This represents a strong focus on advanced statistical modeling directly relevant to ecological data science.  
* **Laura Leites (Research Professor, Quantitative Forest Ecology; Assistant Dean):** Focuses on quantifying, modeling, and mapping forest ecosystem attributes and processes, particularly forest responses to climate change. Her expertise includes ecological genetics, decision support tools, and the use of remote sensing data (e.g., LiDAR) and spatial point process modeling. She teaches courses on forest ecosystem monitoring/data analysis (FOR 350\) and quantitative modeling (FOR 597A).55 Her work directly bridges quantitative forest ecology with computational methods and climate change applications.  
* **Marc McDill (Associate Professor, Forest Management):** Research encompasses forest management planning, economics, operations research, growth and yield modeling, timber supply analysis, and GIS. He develops and applies optimization and simulation techniques, including spatially explicit harvest-scheduling models, and utilizes technologies like UAS-based LiDAR.55 His expertise links computational optimization and spatial analysis to practical forest management decision-making.  
* **David A.W. Miller (Associate Professor, Wildlife Population Ecology):** Focuses on population ecology, quantitative ecology (avian and amphibian), conservation decision analysis, and life-history evolution. His research involves integrating multiple data sources (data fusion), using hierarchical models (e.g., occupancy, spatial capture-recapture), and applying computational approaches to analyze large-scale ecological patterns, such as climate impacts on communities.55 This demonstrates strength in quantitative population modeling and data integration for ecological inference.

Other ESM faculty possess expertise in related areas that often employ quantitative and spatial methods, such as pedology, hydrology, soil biogeochemistry, disturbance ecology, and genetics.55 Notably, Li Guo (Hydropedology) and Estelle Couradeau (Soils/Environmental Microbiology) have been involved in seed grants proposing the use of machine learning 66, indicating emerging applications of these techniques within the department, often facilitated by external collaborations or support mechanisms like ICDS.

**Faculty Expertise in Affiliated Units (ICDS, IST, CSE, STAT, IEE, Geography, ABE, etc.)**

Significant expertise in core AI, ML, data science, and HPC resides in departments and institutes outside ESM, many of which are interconnected through the Institute for Computational and Data Sciences (ICDS).

* **ICDS Leadership & Affiliates:**  
  * **Vasant Honavar (IST):** Professor and Edward Frymoyer Chair, founding Director of the Center for Artificial Intelligence Foundations and Scientific Applications (CENSAI), Associate Director of ICDS. Expertise spans AI, ML, causal inference, knowledge representation, data sciences, with applications in bioinformatics and health informatics.68 Provides top-level AI/ML leadership with experience in biological data.  
  * **Guido Cervone (Geography/Meteorology):** Professor and Interim Director of ICDS. Expertise in computational algorithms, AI/ML, remote sensing, and big data analysis (including social media) for environmental hazards and renewable energy.68 Leads applications of AI/ML to earth/environmental sciences.  
  * **David Hunter (Statistics):** Professor and Associate Director of ICDS. Provides statistical expertise at the ICDS leadership level.68  
  * **Mahmut Kandemir (CSE):** Distinguished Professor and Associate Director of ICDS. Expertise in computer architecture, compilers, and HPC systems.68 Focuses on the underlying infrastructure for computation.  
  * **Aleksandra Slavkovic (Statistics):** Professor and ICDS Associate, involved with CENSAI. Senior statistician contributing to AI initiatives.69  
* **Other Relevant Faculty:**  
  * **Long He (Agricultural & Biological Engineering \- ABE):** Assistant Professor with expertise in robotics, precision agriculture, UAVs, remote sensing, and AI applications in agricultural systems.77  
  * **Suat Irmak (ABE):** Professor with expertise in AI, automation, robotics, and advanced controls in agriculture.77 (Expertise in ABE demonstrates application of AI/robotics in related fields).  
  * **Amy Burnicki (Geography):** Associate Teaching Professor specializing in spatial data analysis, spatial statistics, quantitative modeling, and land change science.78  
  * **Faculty in CSE/IST/Statistics:** Numerous faculty teaching the advanced courses listed in Section 4.0 possess core expertise in AI, ML, algorithms, data management, and computational statistics.

**Analysis of Expertise Distribution**

The distribution of expertise reveals distinct strengths. The ESM department houses significant talent in applying quantitative methods—statistical modeling (especially Bayesian approaches), ecological simulation, spatial analysis (GIS/remote sensing), and operations research—directly to forestry and wildlife ecology problems.53 This provides a strong foundation for data-intensive research within the discipline.

However, faculty whose primary research focus is the development and cutting-edge application of *AI and ML algorithms* appear to be concentrated outside ESM, primarily within IST, CSE, Statistics, and potentially other departments like Geography or ABE.68 While ESM faculty are beginning to utilize ML, often through collaborations or seed grants 66, deep expertise in AI/ML methodology largely resides elsewhere in the university.

This distribution underscores the critical role of interdisciplinary collaboration. The Institute for Computational and Data Sciences (ICDS) serves as a vital hub connecting domain scientists in ESM with computational experts across campus.68 Its leadership structure, involving faculty from IST, CSE, and Statistics 68, and its system of co-hired and affiliated faculty 68, are designed to facilitate exactly these kinds of cross-disciplinary partnerships. Leveraging ICDS resources and personnel appears essential for integrating the most advanced AI/ML techniques into forestry research at Penn State.

## **High-Performance Computing (HPC) Resources: ICDS Roar**

Penn State provides centralized High-Performance Computing (HPC) resources through the Institute for Computational and Data Sciences (ICDS), primarily via the **Roar** supercomputing system. These resources are crucial for computationally intensive research, including large-scale simulations, complex data analysis, and training AI/ML models.

**Overview and Structure**

ICDS manages and operates the Roar system, which serves as the university's flagship research computing cluster.80 Roar is designed to support a wide range of computational tasks, including advanced simulation, statistical modeling, data analysis, data mining, and machine learning.83

The system comprises two main environments 84:

1. **Roar Collab:** The primary cluster for general research use, designed with collaboration in mind and featuring more frequent software and hardware updates.82 This is the likely environment for most forestry and ecosystem science research unless restricted data is involved.  
2. **Roar Restricted:** A separate cluster maintained specifically for researchers working with sensitive or restricted data requiring compliance with standards like NIST 800-171.84

Users interact with the cluster via submit nodes or a web portal to prepare and submit jobs, which are then executed on various types of compute nodes, accessing shared file storage.84

**System Specifications (Roar Collab)**

Roar Collab is a heterogeneous cluster, meaning it contains different types of compute nodes optimized for various tasks.82 Key node types include:

* **Standard Compute (sc):** These nodes are suitable for moderate memory tasks and multi-node parallel jobs. They typically feature 24 or 48 cores per node, with 256 GB to 512 GB of RAM (approximately 8-10 GB RAM per core) and are connected via high-bandwidth Infiniband networking.82  
* **High-Memory (hc):** Designed for memory-intensive tasks, these nodes offer significantly more RAM per core. Configurations include 40 or 56 cores with 1 TB of RAM (approximately 25 GB RAM per core), also connected via Infiniband.82  
* **Basic Compute (bc):** Intended for minimal memory or high-throughput single-node tasks, these nodes have 24 to 64 cores with 128 GB to 256 GB RAM (around 4-5 GB RAM per core) and use standard Ethernet networking.82  
* **GPU Compute (gc):** Nodes equipped with Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) for accelerating specific types of computations, particularly common in ML/AI.82  
* **Interactive (ic):** Nodes designed for interactive use, potentially with GPU capabilities optimized for graphical software.82

Overall, the Roar system boasts over 40,000 CPU cores and substantial memory capacity, providing significant computational power.83

**GPU Resources (Roar Collab)**

ICDS provides access to a considerable number of GPUs, essential for accelerating many AI/ML workloads.

* **Availability:** The Roar system collectively has over 250 GPUs.83 Roar Collab specifically offers nodes equipped with NVIDIA A100 and NVIDIA P100 GPUs.82  
* **Node Configurations:**  
  * A100 GPU nodes typically contain 2 A100 GPUs, 48 CPU cores, and 384 GB of RAM.85  
  * P100 GPU nodes usually have 1 P100 GPU, 24 CPU cores, and 256 GB or 512 GB of RAM.85  
* **Multi-Instance GPU (MIG):** For users who do not require a full A100 GPU, ICDS offers A100 "slices" (Multi-Instance GPUs). Options include 1/8th slices (\~900 CUDA cores, 5GB VRAM, 3 CPU cores, 24GB RAM) and potentially larger slices.85 This allows for more cost-effective access to GPU acceleration for smaller tasks.  
* **Access:** GPUs are requested within job submission scripts using Slurm directives (e.g., \--gres=gpu:1 to request one GPU, or \--gres=gpu:a100:1 to request a specific type).87 Tools like VirtualGL are available for running graphical applications that require GPU acceleration.87

**Software Stack**

Roar Collab runs on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8\.82 Access to software is managed primarily through a module system (Lmod), allowing users to load specific versions of applications and libraries needed for their work.88 The software stack is updated biannually.88

* **Common Research Software:** Includes widely used applications like MATLAB, R, COMSOL, Abaqus, Gaussian, LAMMPS, GROMACS, and various compilers and libraries.88  
* **Programming Languages & Tools:** Supports C, Fortran, Python, R, Matlab, Mathematica, Git, CMake, Make, and includes libraries for parallel programming (MPI).89  
* **AI/ML Frameworks:** While specific frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn are not explicitly listed as base modules in the provided documentation snippets, the **Anaconda** Python distribution is available (e.g., anaconda3/2021.05).88 Anaconda is the standard platform for managing Python environments and packages in data science and ML. It is highly probable that users can access TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, and other necessary libraries by loading the Anaconda module and managing packages within their own conda environments.90 The mention of an ICDS workshop focusing on Tensorflow and Spark further supports the usability of these tools on the system.91 Python support also includes libraries like PyCUDA for GPU programming.89 Users requiring software not in the central stack can request its addition or install it within their allocated storage space.88

**Access Policies and Costs (for College of Agricultural Sciences / ESM)**

Faculty, staff, and students in the College of Agricultural Sciences and the ESM department, like all Penn State affiliates, have several ways to access Roar resources:

* **Open Queue (Free Access):** All Penn State users automatically have access to the Roar Collab "open queue" at no charge.93 This allows users to run jobs using idle compute resources. However, this access tier has limitations: a maximum job runtime (wall-time) of 48 hours, limits on the number of concurrent jobs and resources (100 pending jobs, 100 cores, 800GB memory per user), and the possibility of jobs being preempted (cancelled) if the resources are needed by users with paid allocations.93 Jobs can be set to automatically requeue upon preemption using the \--requeue directive.93 While adequate for many introductory or smaller tasks, the time limit and preemption risk can be problematic for long-running simulations or large ML model training.94  
* **Paid Allocations (Guaranteed Access):** Researchers or groups requiring guaranteed access, longer run times (beyond 48 hours), or specific resource configurations without risk of preemption can purchase compute allocations.85 These typically involve a minimum 36-month commitment and provide dedicated access to a certain amount of resources (e.g., core-hours on specific node types, GPU access).85 Purchasing compute cores often comes with a base amount of free storage (e.g., 5 TiB).85 Accessing these resources requires specifying the appropriate compute account (e.g., \-A \<compute\_account\>) when submitting jobs.95 Indicative monthly costs (as of Feb 2024, reflecting Provost subsidies) range from $80 for 20 basic cores to $140 for 20 standard cores, $420 for 20 high-memory cores, $300-$400 per P100/A100 GPU, and $57 for an A100 MIG slice.85 Active storage costs around $33.35 per 5 TiB per month.85  
* **Credit Accounts (Pay-per-use):** A flexible pay-per-use model where users purchase compute credits and are charged based on the resources consumed.87 This allows access to various hardware partitions (basic, standard, high-memory, GPU) and run times longer than 48 hours, paying only for what is used.87 This requires specifying the desired hardware partition when submitting jobs.87  
* **Seed Grants/Support:** Programs like the SAFES-RISE seed grants provide funding for RISE team consulting hours or compute resources, offering another avenue for AgSci/ESM faculty to access computational support.97 The NSF-funded RISE program also offers seed grants of support hours.81

The combination of a free Open Queue and various paid options provides a flexible tiered access model. The Open Queue significantly lowers the barrier to entry for students, exploratory research, and smaller computational tasks. However, serious, large-scale, or time-sensitive computational research, particularly long-running simulations or deep learning model training common in advanced AI/ML applications, would likely necessitate a paid allocation or the use of compute credits to overcome the 48-hour limit and preemption risk of the Open Queue.

**Table 6.1: Summary of Roar Collab Compute Resources and Access**

## **Strategic Alignment and Institutional Priorities**

The integration of advanced computation, data science, and AI within Penn State's forestry program is situated within a broader institutional context defined by university, college, and departmental strategic priorities.

**Penn State University Strategic Plan**

The university's overarching strategic plan (revised April 2025, pending final Board of Trustees approval) sets a high-level direction centered on five goals: Enhance Student Success, Grow (Inter)disciplinary Research Excellence, Increase Land-Grant Impact, Foster Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging (DEIB), and Transform Health Care.100 While not explicitly detailing AI or computational methods for forestry, several goals provide a supportive framework:

* **Grow (Inter)disciplinary Research Excellence:** This goal, aiming for Penn State to become a top 15 research institution, emphasizes leveraging interdisciplinary scholarship to address pressing global challenges.100 Complex environmental and natural resource problems inherently require such interdisciplinary approaches, often relying heavily on computational modeling, data analysis, and potentially AI.  
* **Increase Land-Grant Impact:** Focusing on serving Pennsylvania's communities, promoting economic development, research innovation, and workforce growth aligns with applying advanced technologies like data science and AI to state-specific agricultural, forestry, and environmental issues.102  
* **Transform Internal Operations:** While a supporting goal, the focus on efficiency and becoming a modern university could translate into investments in robust digital infrastructure and computational resources that benefit all research areas.102

**Office of the Senior Vice President for Research (OSVPR) Strategic Plan (2020-2025)**

The OSVPR strategic plan provides a much more explicit focus on digital innovation. **Goal 4: Empowering Science and Society Through Digital Innovation** clearly articulates Penn State's ambition to lead in computation and data science.103 Key objectives under this goal include:

* **Building the Ecosystem (Obj 4.1):** Specifically targets establishing leadership in computation and data science by investing in people (including ICDS co-hires), interdisciplinary initiatives, and infrastructure (like the ICDS Roar system). It explicitly mentions advancing AI as a key area.103  
* **State Leadership (Obj 4.2):** Aims to position Penn State as Pennsylvania's leader in advanced computation and data methodologies through outreach, training, and translational research for economic development and societal impact.103  
* **Cyber-ecosystem Leadership (Obj 4.3):** Focuses on leading in the development and partnership surrounding the entire advanced computing ecosystem (hardware, software, methods, experts).103  
* **Digital Collaboration Hub (Obj 4.4):** Envisions Penn State as a global hub for collaborative digital research through scientific software, tools, data repositories, and digital collaboratories.103

This strong emphasis from the central research office signals significant institutional commitment and resource allocation towards advancing computational and data-intensive research across the university, providing a highly favorable environment for disciplines like forestry to leverage these capabilities.

**College of Agricultural Sciences Strategic Guide**

The College of Agricultural Sciences' Strategic Guide (a dynamic document replacing older plans) demonstrates clear alignment with the university's digital push and explicitly incorporates advanced technologies into its vision.104

* **Network Strategic Priorities:** Includes "Technologies for Agriculture and Living Systems (TALiS)," which aims to transform agriculture and living systems using cutting-edge technologies.104 Other relevant priorities include "Resiliency in the Face of Climate Instability" and "Integrated Animal, Human, Plant, and Environmental Health".104  
* **Research Impact Themes:** The "Integrated Ecosystems" theme explicitly states the goal of "harnessing and shaping the capabilities of data analytics, artificial intelligence, machine learning, remote sensing, and predictive technologies to achieve healthy and thriving agriculture, natural systems, economies, and communities".106 This demonstrates direct strategic intent at the college level to apply AI/ML and data science to natural resource and ecosystem challenges, including forestry.  
* **Alignment with Federal Priorities:** The college actively aligns its research strategy with federal agency priorities (USDA, NSF), which increasingly emphasize technology, climate solutions, resilient ecosystems, and data translation.107

The explicit inclusion of AI, ML, and data analytics within the college's strategic framework, particularly under the Integrated Ecosystems theme, provides strong justification and support for research and potentially educational initiatives integrating these technologies within departments like ESM.

**Department of Ecosystem Science and Management (ESM) Strategic Plan**

Specific strategic planning documents for the ESM department as a whole were not identified in the provided resources. However, the department's defined research focus areas signal its direction 108:

* **Ecosystem Analytics:** Explicitly focuses on "Leveraging Big Data to improve ecosystem monitoring and management".108 This area directly implies the use of data science and computational methods.  
* **Other Areas:** Ecosystem Conservation and Restoration, Climate Change Solutions, and Harmful Species Ecology are all areas where advanced computation, modeling, and data analysis are increasingly applied.108

The **Center for Private Forests**, housed within ESM, does have a specific 2022-2026 strategic plan.109 Its aims focus primarily on scholarship related to private landowners, inspiring stewardship, strengthening connections, informing policy, and building infrastructure.109 While quantitative and computational methods could certainly support the "Create Scholarship" aim, the plan does not explicitly prioritize the development or integration of AI/ML technologies as a core strategy.

The lack of a readily identifiable, department-wide strategic plan specifically detailing the integration of advanced AI/ML into ESM's core forestry and natural resource programs (beyond the existing strengths in quantitative modeling and spatial analysis highlighted in the "Ecosystem Analytics" area) suggests a potential gap. While the university and college strategies provide strong top-down support, the specific implementation within the forestry curriculum and departmental research initiatives might currently rely more on individual faculty interests and broader college directives (like the TALiS priority or Integrated Ecosystems theme) rather than a dedicated, formalized departmental strategy for AI/ML integration.

## **Research Centers, Grants, and Partnerships**

Penn State's research ecosystem includes numerous centers, funding mechanisms, and partnerships that facilitate interdisciplinary work, particularly at the intersection of computation, data science, and environmental or agricultural sciences.

**Key Research Centers**

Several institutes and centers play crucial roles in supporting and connecting researchers:

* **Institute for Computational and Data Sciences (ICDS):** As the central hub for advanced computation and data science, ICDS manages the Roar HPC resources, employs research computing staff (RISE team), supports a large community of co-hired and affiliated faculty, and hosts specialized centers within its "AI Hub".68 The AI Hub includes the Center for Artificial Intelligence Foundations and Scientific Applications (CENSAI), Applications of AI and ML to Industry (AIMI), Center for AI Foundations and Engineered Systems (CAFE), and the Center for Socially Responsible AI.111 ICDS is fundamental for accessing expertise and infrastructure.  
* **Institutes of Energy and the Environment (IEE):** Connects researchers working on energy and environmental challenges across five themes: Climate and Natural Systems, Health and the Environment, Integrated Energy Systems, Equitable Communities and the Built Environment, and Water Sustainability.112 IEE supports numerous affiliated centers (e.g., Center for BioRenewables, Earth and Environmental Systems Institute (EESI), Ecology Institute, SAFES) and offers seed grant funding.113 Its broad network (over 1000 affiliates) facilitates collaboration on environmental topics.115  
* **Institute for Sustainable Agricultural, Food, and Environmental Science (SAFES):** Housed within the College of Agricultural Sciences, SAFES focuses on accelerating solutions to complex landscape-level challenges related to agriculture, food, and the environment.113 It runs seed grant programs, sometimes jointly with ICDS/RISE, to support research in these areas.81  
* **ESM-Housed Centers:** The Department of Ecosystem Science and Management hosts the **Center for Private Forests**, focused on landowner outreach, research, and policy 2, and the **Schatz Center for Tree Molecular Genetics**, focused on forest genetics.1

This robust network of centers provides infrastructure, funding opportunities, and mechanisms for connecting researchers from different disciplines, which is essential for applying advanced computational techniques to complex environmental and forestry problems.

**Funded Projects and Grants**

Specific examples illustrate the application of AI, data science, and advanced computation in forestry-related and environmental research at Penn State, often supported by internal seed funding or external grants:

* **Direct ESM Involvement:**  
  * An ICDS seed grant (2019) supported ESM faculty (Guo, Burkhart) in using **machine learning** and soil mapping to predict ginseng locations.67  
  * A SAFES-RISE seed grant helped ESM faculty (Duncan) manage and process large **LiDAR datasets** for watershed mapping, utilizing ICDS RISE team support.98  
  * An IEE seed grant (2022) supported ESM faculty (Couradeau) in developing a system for monitoring soil N2O emissions, proposing the use of resulting data to train **machine learning algorithms**.66  
* **Related Environmental/Agricultural AI/ML Projects:**  
  * A USDA grant ($650k, 2024\) funds a project using **deep learning** to generate continuous water quality (nitrate) data based on sensor readings and environmental characteristics.117  
  * An IEE seed grant (2016) used **machine learning** for a smartphone app to diagnose plant diseases.118  
  * A College of IST seed grant (2024) funds research using **AI** to estimate poultry body weights from depth images.119  
* **Broader Computational Environmental Science:**  
  * An IEE seed grant (2016) linked genotype, phenotype, and environment to understand climate adaptation in forest trees, likely involving significant **data analysis and modeling**.118  
  * An IEE seed grant (2016) used **UAS-based LiDAR/multispectral systems** for mapping forests and wetlands, requiring computational data processing.118  
  * An ICDS seed grant (2019) supported simulation of species migration mechanisms.67  
* **Funding Mechanisms:**  
  * Internal seed grants from ICDS, IEE, SAFES, and IST are crucial for initiating projects and leveraging computational resources.66  
  * The ICDS RISE team, partly funded by an NSF CC\* grant, provides dedicated computational science and engineering support to researchers, often initiated via seed grants providing hours of support.81  
  * The ICDS Junior Researcher Collaborations program provides funding for early-career researchers working on AI/computational projects.121

These examples demonstrate active research utilizing AI, ML, and advanced computation in environmental science, agriculture, and directly within ESM at Penn State. The seed grant programs, particularly those involving the RISE team, appear to be effective mechanisms for enabling faculty to adopt and apply these complex technologies.

**Partnerships**

Collaboration is a key feature of Penn State's research landscape:

* **Internal:** Institutes like ICDS, IEE, and SAFES are explicitly designed to foster inter-college and interdepartmental collaboration.81 The ICDS RISE team acts as a direct collaborative partner for researchers needing computational expertise.81 Grant examples show collaborations between ESM, Ag Economics, Math, IST, and others.67  
* **External:** Penn State engages with federal funding agencies (NSF, USDA, NIH, DOE) 107, state agencies (e.g., PA DCNR) 98, industry partners (potentially via ICDS centers like AIMI) 111, and other academic institutions (e.g., Northeast Big Data Hub).70

The existence of these centers and funding mechanisms clearly facilitates the interdisciplinary work necessary to apply cutting-edge computational methods to forestry and environmental science.

## **AI Ethics and Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR)**

Penn State maintains frameworks for guiding the ethical use of AI and ensuring responsible conduct of research (RCR), which apply to faculty and students in the Department of Ecosystem Science and Management (ESM).

**9.1 University-Wide AI Guidelines**

Recognizing the rapid evolution of AI, Penn State has established guidelines, managed through its AI Hub, to govern the use of AI tools, particularly generative AI.123 Key principles include:

* **Ethical Use:** Users are expected to consider ethical implications, verify the accuracy and reliability of AI outputs, check for bias and discrimination, and properly cite AI tools when used.123  
* **Data Confidentiality:** A critical guideline prohibits the use of publicly available AI tools (like standard ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) for any non-public, confidential, proprietary, or personal information (including data protected by FERPA, HIPAA, GLBA).123 Information entered into such tools could be used for model training and potentially exposed.123  
* **Approved Tools for Sensitive Data:** For processing sensitive data (classified under Penn State policy AD95 as Moderate, High, or Restricted), researchers must use institutionally approved platforms secured through vendor agreements, such as Amazon Bedrock, Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service, or Google Vertex AI, often requiring specific configurations like Secure Enclaves.123 Access to these platforms typically requires a request process.123  
* **Disclosure and Academic Integrity:** Users must disclose their use of AI as appropriate (e.g., to instructors, supervisors, journal editors).123 In academic settings, using generative AI for assignments is considered an academic integrity violation unless explicitly authorized by the instructor.125  
* **Accessibility:** University policy AD69 requires that AI tools used for institutional purposes (e.g., in classrooms, offices) undergo an accessibility review.123

These guidelines provide a framework for navigating the ethical and practical challenges of using AI, emphasizing data security, accuracy, transparency, and compliance with existing policies.

**Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) Framework: SARI**

Penn State mandates RCR training for all graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and new faculty through its Scholarship and Research Integrity (SARI) program.127 Undergraduate students involved in research, especially if funded by NSF, NIFA, or NIH, or leading to publication, also require training.128 The SARI program aims to instill awareness of established professional norms and ethical principles in research 128 and helps fulfill RCR training requirements mandated by funding agencies.127

The SARI program has two main components 128:

1. **Online Training (CITI):** Requires completion of at least one online course via the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI). The general RCR course is recommended for most, covering topics like authorship, plagiarism, data management, mentorship, peer review, collaboration, research misconduct, conflicts of interest, and research involving human or animal subjects.127 Specific funding (NSF, NIFA) mandates the RCR course.128 Training for human or animal subjects research requires periodic renewal.128  
2. **Discussion-Based Education:** Graduate students must complete a minimum of five hours of interactive, discussion-based RCR education.128 This requirement is typically fulfilled through courses or workshops organized by the student's specific graduate program.128 New faculty have an alternative option for in-person training.128

**ESM Department SARI Implementation**

The Department of Ecosystem Science and Management implements the SARI discussion-based requirement through dedicated graduate courses. Students in the Forest Resources M.S. program and the Wildlife and Fisheries Science Ph.D. program typically fulfill the 5-hour requirement by completing FOR 597 or WFS 597 ("Research, Integrity, & Communication"), respectively. These 1-credit courses include a 5-hour SARI workshop component.131 Students in the dual-title Ecology program often meet the requirement through ECLGY 515\.135 Completion is tracked by the graduate program administrator in LionPath.128

**Information Security Policies**

Underpinning both RCR and AI ethics are university-wide information security policies:

* **AD95 (Information Assurance and IT Security):** This core policy establishes the framework for protecting university information assets, defines data classification levels (Low, Moderate, High, Restricted), mandates risk assessments for sensitive systems, and requires adherence to security standards.126 This policy directly informs the AI guidelines regarding data handling.123  
* **AD96 (Acceptable Use):** Defines appropriate use of university IT resources.126

Penn State possesses a formalized and mandatory RCR training structure (SARI) that ensures all researchers receive baseline education in research ethics, with specific implementation tailored at the graduate program level (e.g., FOR/WFS 597 in ESM). While this provides a strong foundation, specific guidance related to the unique ethical challenges of AI is newer and evolving, disseminated through the AI Hub. This AI guidance emphasizes critical issues like data privacy (especially concerning public AI tools), the need for verification and bias checks, and disclosure requirements. The existing IT security policies, particularly AD95's data classification scheme, form a crucial foundation for governing the appropriate use of different AI tools with varying levels of data sensitivity.

## **Synthesis and Analysis**

This analysis reveals that Penn State University possesses substantial resources and a strategic commitment relevant to integrating advanced computation, data science, and AI into its forestry program, but also faces challenges in fully realizing this potential within the current structure.

**10.1 Strengths**

* **Established Program:** The SAF-accredited B.S. in Forest Ecosystem Management provides a strong disciplinary foundation with multiple specialization options and a long history.1 An associated A.S. degree at Mont Alto provides a technical pathway.8  
* **Quantitative Expertise within ESM:** The department houses faculty with significant expertise in quantitative ecology, forest modeling (including climate response), spatial analysis (GIS/LiDAR/remote sensing), Bayesian statistics, and operations research applied to forestry and wildlife.52  
* **Strong GIS Integration:** Clear pathways exist for students to gain in-depth GIS skills through established minors and certificates offered by the Geography department, which integrate well with the forestry curriculum.20  
* **Robust HPC Infrastructure:** ICDS provides powerful and accessible central HPC resources (Roar/Roar Collab) with ample CPU cores, diverse memory configurations, and modern GPU accelerators (A100s/P100s/MIG) suitable for demanding computational research, including AI/ML.82  
* **Flexible HPC Access:** A tiered access model including a free Open Queue lowers barriers, while paid allocations and credit options provide guaranteed resources for intensive research.85  
* **Strategic Institutional Support:** High-level strategic plans (University, OSVPR, College of Agricultural Sciences) explicitly prioritize digital innovation, computation, data science, and AI, including applications in agriculture and natural systems.100  
* **Interdisciplinary Ecosystem:** Institutes like ICDS, IEE, and SAFES actively foster collaboration and provide resources (funding, expertise via RISE team) to bridge disciplinary gaps.81  
* **Formalized Ethics Framework:** A mandatory RCR training program (SARI) is well-established, and evolving guidelines for AI ethics address key contemporary concerns.123

**Weaknesses/Challenges**

* **Curriculum Gaps in Advanced Computation:** The core undergraduate forestry curriculum, while providing foundational statistics and GIS, lacks required coursework in advanced programming (Python/R beyond basics), data structures, algorithms, or specific AI/ML techniques.6 Integration is concentrated in upper-level electives or specific options.16  
* **Prerequisite Barriers:** Forestry students face significant prerequisite hurdles (Calculus II, Linear Algebra, CS fundamentals) to access advanced AI/ML/Data Science courses offered by IST, CSE, and Statistics.31  
* **Concentration of AI/ML Expertise:** Deep expertise in developing and applying cutting-edge AI/ML algorithms resides primarily outside the ESM department, necessitating cross-disciplinary collaboration for advanced applications.68  
* **Departmental Strategic Focus:** While college and university plans are supportive, there is no evidence in the provided materials of a specific, formalized ESM departmental strategic plan prioritizing the integration of advanced AI/ML across its programs beyond existing quantitative strengths.108  
* **HPC Open Queue Limitations:** The free Open Queue's 48-hour runtime limit and potential for job preemption may hinder large-scale computational tasks common in advanced modeling or ML.93

**Opportunities**

* **Leverage ICDS:** Increase utilization of ICDS resources, including the RISE team for project support, AI Hub expertise, and co-hired faculty collaborations, for both research and potentially curriculum enhancement in forestry.81  
* **Develop Curricular Pathways:** Create clearer pathways, potentially through dedicated course sequences, bridge courses, or tailored minors/certificates, to equip forestry students with the prerequisites needed for advanced computational coursework in other departments.  
* **Foster Explicit Collaborations:** Actively promote joint research projects and grant proposals between ESM faculty and AI/ML experts in IST, CSE, Statistics, and other relevant units, leveraging ICDS and IEE as facilitators.67  
* **Enhance RCR/Ethics Training:** Integrate AI-specific ethical considerations and responsible data science practices more explicitly into the ESM-specific SARI training (e.g., FOR/WFS 597\) or relevant coursework.123  
* **Utilize Data Science Custom Focus:** Explore the potential of the B.S. in Data Sciences' custom application focus area 31 to create a structured path for students deeply interested in both forestry applications and data science methods, while acknowledging this doesn't replace the SAF-accredited degree.

**Potential Implications**

Penn State possesses the institutional will, high-level expertise, and computational infrastructure to be a leader in computationally-driven forestry research and education. Graduates from the current Forest Ecosystem Management program receive solid training in forestry principles and foundational quantitative/GIS skills. However, without proactively pursuing additional coursework or minors, they may lack the specific advanced programming, AI, and ML skills increasingly valued in computationally intensive research roles and certain industry positions. Bridging the gap between the forestry program's current requirements and the advanced computational offerings elsewhere in the university requires deliberate, structured efforts in curriculum development, prerequisite management, and fostering interdisciplinary connections. The existing strengths in quantitative faculty within ESM, coupled with the resources of ICDS and supportive institutional strategies, provide a strong foundation upon which to build.

## **Conclusion**

Penn State University presents a complex picture regarding the integration of AI, Data Science, and HPC into its SAF-accredited forestry program. The university benefits from a well-regarded Forest Ecosystem Management program within the College of Agricultural Sciences, significant institutional strategic commitment to digital innovation and computation spearheaded by OSVPR and ICDS, robust and accessible HPC infrastructure via ICDS Roar, and strong foundational expertise in quantitative ecology and spatial analysis within the ESM department itself. Clear pathways exist for students to specialize in GIS.

However, significant challenges remain in seamlessly integrating cutting-edge AI, ML, and advanced data science techniques into the core undergraduate forestry experience. The primary obstacles are the lack of required advanced computational coursework within the major and the substantial prerequisite barriers forestry students face when attempting to access relevant advanced courses in IST, CSE, or Statistics. While Penn State possesses top-tier expertise in AI/ML, it is largely housed outside the ESM department, making interdisciplinary collaboration, facilitated by centers like ICDS, essential for applying these methods to forestry problems.

Overall, Penn State has the necessary components—faculty expertise (both disciplinary and computational), high-performance computing resources, interdisciplinary centers, and strategic backing—to effectively leverage AI, data science, and HPC in forestry. Realizing this potential fully, particularly at the undergraduate level, will require focused efforts to bridge existing curricular gaps, facilitate access to advanced computational coursework, and further encourage collaboration between ecosystem scientists and AI/data science experts. Without such deliberate integration, forestry students may need to independently navigate complex inter-college pathways to acquire the advanced computational skill set demanded by the evolving landscape of natural resource management and research.
