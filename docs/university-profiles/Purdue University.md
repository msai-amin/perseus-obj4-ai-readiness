### **Software Stack for AI/ML**

RCAC provides access to standard AI and machine learning frameworks, facilitating research in these areas:

* **Core Frameworks:** Modules for popular libraries **PyTorch** and **TensorFlow** are readily available on various clusters, including Bell, Negishi, Gilbreth, Anvil, and Scholar.205 Specific versions may vary by cluster.205  
* **ML-Toolkit Module:** A convenient ml-toolkit module bundles several common ML libraries (caffe, cntk, gym, keras, mxnet, opencv, pytorch, tensorflow, tflearn, theano), simplifying the environment setup for users needing multiple tools.206 Both CPU and GPU-enabled versions are typically offered.206  
* **Access Method:** Users typically load a base learning module or the specific ml-toolkit module, followed by the desired library module (e.g., module load pytorch).205  
* **Custom Environments:** Recognizing the complex and often specific dependencies of ML workflows, RCAC supports the use of **Anaconda** (module load anaconda).209 Users can create their own conda environments (using tools like conda-env-mod) to install specific versions of libraries (like TensorFlow or PyTorch) and manage dependencies using pip or conda.209 This is often necessary as many ML packages bundle their required CUDA toolkit versions, potentially conflicting with system-wide modules.209  
* **Visualization:** **TensorBoard** is supported for visualizing TensorFlow session data, though access might require running the browser on a cluster node (e.g., via ThinLinc) due to firewall restrictions.209

This dual approach—providing standard modules for common use cases and enabling user-managed environments via Anaconda—offers both ease of access for beginners or standard workflows, and the flexibility required for advanced users with specific software version or dependency needs. This is crucial in the rapidly evolving landscape of AI/ML software.

### **Access Policies and Eligibility**

Access to RCAC resources is generally broad but follows specific eligibility criteria and procedures:

* **Eligibility:** Purdue faculty, staff, and students are typically eligible. Affiliates collaborating closely with Purdue researchers and users involved in partner projects (like ACCESS via NSF allocations or Open Science Grid) can also gain access.187 Eligibility for specific resources may vary.212  
* **Community Cluster Access:** Access to nodes within community clusters (Bell, Negishi, Gilbreth, Gautschi, Rossmann) usually requires the researcher's faculty/staff sponsor or research group to have purchased access (nodes or shares).213 The Principal Investigator (PI) or their designee typically manages user access to their group's allocation using self-service tools.213  
* **External Collaborators:** Non-Purdue collaborators generally need a Purdue Career Account, which must be sponsored by a current Purdue faculty or staff member through a Request for Privileges (R4P) submitted via their business office.202 Specific access permissions depend on the collaboration and data agreements.202  
* **Industry Access:** Industry partners can utilize RCAC resources through sponsored research agreements or specific service packages that include compute time, storage, and support.214  
* **ACCESS Users:** Researchers with allocations on the national ACCESS infrastructure can utilize Anvil.67  
* **Data Storage Access:** Accessing shared storage like the Data Depot involves specific network paths (e.g., \\\\datadepot.rcac.purdue.edu\\depot\\\<group\_name\>) and Purdue authentication.213 Access to secure storage environments like REED+ requires formal requests and approval processes, often involving Data Usage Agreements (DUAs).202

This tiered access structure ensures that resources are available to the broad Purdue research community while managing access based on affiliation, funding source (purchase or allocation), and collaboration status. The requirement for external collaborators to be sponsored by Purdue personnel maintains accountability and aligns usage with Purdue's research mission.202

## **6\. Research Conduct, Integrity, and Ethics**

Purdue University maintains a strong framework for ensuring research integrity and ethical conduct, encompassing mandatory training, formal policies for addressing misconduct, and evolving guidelines for data handling and the use of artificial intelligence.

### **6.1. Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) Training**

Purdue implemented a comprehensive, mandatory Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) training standard (S20) effective July 1, 2020, applicable to all individuals involved in designing, conducting, reporting, or publishing research, including faculty, staff, postdocs, graduate students (in thesis/research programs), and undergraduate researchers.215 The Graduate School also maintains parallel requirements for graduate students and faculty.216

The training program consists of two key components 215:

1. **Online Training (CITI Program):** All researchers must complete a core online course through the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI). Separate basic courses exist for undergraduates versus faculty/postdocs/graduate students.215 These modules cover fundamental RCR topics such as authorship, plagiarism, data management, conflicts of interest, peer review, mentorship, and research misconduct.216 Completion typically requires achieving an average score of 80% or higher across the required modules.218 The CITI Program is a widely recognized platform for research ethics training.221  
2. **Field-Specific Training:** This component involves discipline-based discussions, workshops, or seminars designed to provide context-specific understanding and application of RCR principles.215 Colleges, schools, or research centers organize these sessions.217 For on-campus graduate students, this typically involves attending a mandatory workshop or seminar (often 60-90 minutes or longer) during their first year, sometimes integrated into orientation courses (e.g., CE 69100\) or offered by the Graduate School or specific departments/colleges.218 This component is mandatory for on-campus graduate students but generally encouraged/optional for fully online graduate students.219

**Completion Timelines and Tracking:** Deadlines for completing the CITI training are typically within 30-60 days of starting research or enrollment (30 days if paid from grants, 60 days for other graduate students, 120 days for faculty/staff, 30 days for undergraduate researchers).217 Field-specific training for graduate students is often required within the first semester or year.220 Completion is tracked centrally, but students are often required to submit CITI certificates and proof of workshop attendance to their respective graduate program offices.218 Recertification for the CITI training is generally required every 5 years, although specific grant requirements (e.g., NSF, NIH) may necessitate more frequent updates.218

This two-pronged approach ensures that all researchers receive foundational training on core ethical principles through the standardized CITI platform, while the field-specific component allows for nuanced discussion and application relevant to particular disciplines and research contexts.215 The mandatory nature of the program underscores the university's commitment to fostering a culture of research integrity.215

The following table summarizes the RCR training requirements:

| Researcher Type | Online Training Requirement (CITI) | Completion Deadline (Online) | Field-Specific Training Requirement | Completion Timing (Field-Specific) | Recertification | Snippets |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Faculty / Staff / Postdoc** | RCR Basic (Faculty, Postdoc, Grad) | 120 days from employment (or 30 days if paid from grant) | Required (Discussions/Workshops/Seminars by Unit) | Varies by unit | Every 5 years (or per grant reqs) | 215 |
| **Graduate Student (On-Campus)** | RCR Basic (Faculty, Postdoc, Grad) | 60 days from enrollment (or 30 days if paid from grant) | Required (Min. 60-90 min Seminar/Workshop by Program/Grad School) | Typically 1st Semester/Year | Every 5 years (or per grant reqs) | 215 |
| **Graduate Student (Online)** | RCR Basic (Faculty, Postdoc, Grad) | 60 days from enrollment (or 30 days if paid from grant) | Encouraged, but not mandatory | N/A | Every 5 years (or per grant reqs) | 219 |
| **Undergraduate Researcher** | RCR Basic (Undergraduate) | 30 days from start of research project/appointment | Required (Discussions/Workshops/Seminars by Unit) | Varies by unit | Every 5 years (or per grant reqs) | 215 |

### 

### **Research Integrity Policies and Office**

Purdue University Policy II.A.2 formally addresses research misconduct, defined as fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism (FFP) in proposing, performing, or reviewing research, or in reporting research results.222 The policy emphasizes the university's commitment to truth, objectivity, and honesty in research and outlines procedures designed to be fair, thorough, and objective.229 Issues such as authorship disputes or conflicts of interest, while potentially related, are generally addressed under separate policies.230

The **Research Integrity Officer (RIO)**, currently Dr. Jamie Mohler, plays a central role in administering this policy.229 The RIO receives and assesses allegations of research misconduct, ensures compliance with applicable regulations (including federal requirements from PHS/ORI, NSF, DoD, NASA) 230, coordinates the inquiry and investigation processes, trains committee members, and maintains records.229 The process involves distinct stages: Initial Assessment by the RIO, Inquiry by an Inquiry Committee, Investigation by an Investigation Committee (if warranted), and potential Appeals.230 Confidentiality is maintained throughout the process to protect involved parties.229 All Purdue associates (faculty, staff, students, etc.) are required to report observed potential research misconduct.230 This formalized structure provides a clear pathway for addressing allegations while ensuring due process and compliance with external mandates.

### **Data Handling and AI Ethics Guidelines**

Complementing RCR training and misconduct policies are guidelines addressing the handling of research data and the emerging ethical considerations surrounding AI.

* **Data Handling and Security:** Purdue classifies institutional data as Public, Sensitive, or Restricted, dictating the required level of protection.233 Policy VII.B.8 (Information Security and Privacy) and related standards (e.g., VII.A.4 Acceptable Use) outline responsibilities for safeguarding data.233 Data Stewards oversee specific data domains.233 Increasingly, compliance with standards like ISO and NSPM-33 necessitates stricter controls, including mandatory enrollment of university-owned devices in management systems (Jamf Pro for Apple, MECM for Windows) to ensure security and compliance, while aiming to respect user privacy.234 Secure environments like REED+ are available for handling sensitive or restricted data (e.g., HIPAA, CUI, IRB-related).202 Data governance structures, including an executive council and committees, provide oversight for data management and ensure responsible use.235  
* **AI Ethics and Use:** Purdue IT provides evolving guidelines for the use of Generative AI (GenAI) tools.236 Key principles include using AI as a collaborative tool, maintaining integrity and transparency, ensuring data security, verifying AI output accuracy, checking for bias, and exercising human oversight.236 Specific guidance cautions against inputting sensitive or proprietary information into public AI tools.236 Instructors are advised to clearly state policies on AI use in their syllabi, including whether specific tools are authorized or unauthorized for assignments, how detection might be employed (while cautioning against reliance on current detection tools due to inaccuracy), and potential consequences for violations.238 Instructors are also reminded of copyright policies regarding sharing course materials with third-party AI and the need to protect student privacy.238 Evaluation criteria for adopting AI tools include assessing accessibility, accuracy, bias mitigation, legal/copyright compliance (including citation/disclosure requirements from publishers like ACM, Elsevier, IEEE, Nature, Sage 239), privacy protection, and ethical alignment.237 Dedicated courses, such as PHIL 20800 (Ethics of Data Science), SCLA 52100/52200 (Societal Impacts/Policy & Ethics of AI), and ECE 59500 (AI, Ethics, and Society), address these issues within the curriculum.75

The university's proactive development of AI guidelines and integration of ethics into the curriculum demonstrates an awareness of the need to navigate the complexities of these powerful technologies responsibly.236 There is an inherent need to balance the drive for innovation and data-intensive research, as promoted by initiatives like IDSI and iDiF 31, with the critical requirements for data security, privacy, and ethical AI deployment. Purdue appears to be addressing this through a combination of policy development, mandatory training (RCR), specialized education (AI ethics courses), and secure infrastructure options (REED+, managed devices).202 Continuous attention to these evolving areas will be crucial as AI and data science become further embedded in the research landscape.

The Department of Forestry and Natural Resources stands out for its nationally recognized, SAF-accredited Forestry program, which integrates traditional ecological principles with modern quantitative, computational, and geospatial techniques.58 The curriculum, particularly through offerings like the Digital Natural Resources minor, equips students with essential skills in GIS, remote sensing, data analysis, and modeling.58 FNR faculty research reflects this integration, heavily employing computational tools and data-driven approaches to address complex ecological challenges like invasive species, climate change impacts, and sustainable forest management, often in collaboration with stakeholders and other university departments.37

Purdue's commitment to AI and Data Science extends across the university, offering multiple academic pathways through the Colleges of Science, Engineering, and Liberal Arts.139 This diverse educational landscape caters to students interested in foundational AI development, applied data analytics, or the critical examination of ethical and societal implications.142 The curriculum increasingly incorporates AI ethics, reflecting a commitment to responsible innovation.75

This robust academic and research activity is supported by significant computational infrastructure managed by the Rosen Center for Advanced Computing (RCAC). RCAC provides access to a powerful and heterogeneous suite of HPC resources, including the flagship Anvil supercomputer and specialized GPU clusters like Gilbreth and Gautschi, equipped with state-of-the-art hardware and software for large-scale simulations and AI/ML workloads.67 The community cluster model and specialized systems enhance accessibility and address diverse research needs, including data security.194

Underpinning this research and educational enterprise is a strong institutional framework for research integrity. The mandatory, comprehensive RCR training program ensures a baseline understanding of ethical principles across the research community 215, while formalized policies and the Research Integrity Office provide mechanisms for addressing misconduct.229 Purdue is also actively navigating the ethical landscape of AI and data, developing guidelines and educational resources to promote responsible practices.236

In conclusion, Purdue University has strategically positioned itself as a leader in applying advanced computational methods, AI, and data science to the fields of forestry, natural resources, agriculture, and environmental science. Its strengths lie in the synergy between its highly-ranked FNR programs, dedicated interdisciplinary research initiatives like iDiF and IDSI, powerful HPC infrastructure via RCAC, and a commitment to ethical research conduct. Future directions will likely involve further deepening the integration of AI across disciplines, expanding digital tool development for stakeholders, refining data governance and AI ethics policies, and continuing to leverage its interdisciplinary structure and computational resources to address pressing global challenges in sustainability and resource management.
