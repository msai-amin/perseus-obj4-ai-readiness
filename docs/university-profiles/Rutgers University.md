## **Strategic Direction and Major Initiatives**

Rutgers University–New Brunswick is guided by a comprehensive strategic framework aimed at enhancing its position as a leading research institution. This involves overarching plans, significant investments in emerging fields like artificial intelligence and data science, and targeted initiatives addressing global challenges such as climate change.

**Rutgers–New Brunswick Academic Master Plan (AMP)**

The Rutgers–New Brunswick Academic Master Plan (AMP) serves as the primary strategic roadmap for the institution, outlining key priorities and initiatives designed to advance its academic mission.14 The plan is structured around four Pillars of Excellence: Scholarly Leadership, Innovative Research, Student Success, and Community Engagement.14 Major university-wide initiatives, including the RAD Collaboratory and the Rutgers Climate and Energy Institute, are explicitly aligned with the goals and objectives set forth in the AMP, particularly the pillars of Innovative Research and Scholarly Leadership.14

**Rutgers Artificial Intelligence and Data Science (RAD) Collaboratory**

A central component of Rutgers-New Brunswick's strategic push into cutting-edge research is the Rutgers Artificial Intelligence and Data Science (RAD) Collaboratory. Launched in Fall 2023 as a Chancellor Signature Initiative (CSI) aligned with the AMP, RAD received an initial investment of $10 million.15 It functions as a virtual hub designed to foster interdisciplinary collaboration among faculty, students, and external partners in AI and data science, aiming to produce groundbreaking insights and practical applications.16

The genesis of RAD lies in the recommendations of the Provost Strategic Task Force on Cyberinfrastructure and Data Science, convened in Fall 2022 to reimagine the university's direction in these critical areas.15 The Collaboratory aims to break down traditional academic silos, creating an ecosystem where researchers from diverse fields—spanning STEM, humanities, and the arts—can converge to tackle complex problems.15

Current research areas within RAD include the Institute for Quantitative Biomedicine/Protein Data Bank and Artificial Intelligence for Society.15 An "AI Grand Challenge" call for proposals is planned to solicit ambitious, interdisciplinary research themes and projects from faculty.16 A key strategy for building capacity involves faculty cluster hires; 11 new faculty positions are planned across four themes: Transparency and Interpretability of AI (SAS), Computational Social Science (SCI, SAS), Data Science-Enabled Engineering (SOE), and AI for Climate and Biodiversity (SEBS, SAS).21 This cross-school hiring approach underscores the initiative's interdisciplinary mandate.

RAD's mission extends beyond research facilitation to include attracting significant external funding (federal, state, industry) and fostering partnerships.16 Student engagement is also integral, supported through new Platforms for Education and Research Cores (PERCs) offering hands-on research experiences, academic credits, and certifications 16, as well as the RAD Collaboratory Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) program.22 Interim leadership is provided by Dr. Stephen K. Burley, with a search for a permanent director planned for Spring 2026\.17

The substantial initial investment, the cross-disciplinary faculty hiring strategy involving multiple schools, the integration of student research programs, and the explicit goal of attracting large-scale external funding collectively signal that RAD represents a comprehensive, high-priority institutional strategy. It aims to establish Rutgers-New Brunswick as a national leader in AI and data science by creating a synergistic ecosystem that transcends departmental boundaries and leverages the university's broad expertise.15

**Rutgers Climate and Energy Institute (RCEI)**

Launched in Fall 2023, the Rutgers Climate and Energy Institute (RCEI) is another Chancellor Signature Initiative aligned with the AMP, focused on addressing climate change and energy challenges.15 RCEI brings together over 150 affiliated faculty and staff from across Rutgers campuses.23

The Institute's research is organized around key themes: Earth System Science (complexities of physical, geochemical, biological systems), Human Dimensions (societal impacts, adaptation, resilience), Renewable Energy, Technology and Energy Conservation, and Climate Change Communication and Environmental Humanities.23 This structure inherently promotes interdisciplinary approaches to climate and energy research.

To stimulate research and external grant activity, RCEI offers internal Groundwork Grants. These modest planning grants support capacity-building activities like collaborative meetings, data analysis, and literature reviews aimed at developing competitive external funding proposals.24 Notably, the theme for the 2025 Groundwork Grants cycle is "Climate, Energy, and Artificial Intelligence," explicitly linking RCEI's mission with the university's broader AI/data science push and encouraging affiliates to leverage AI/ML tools.24 RCEI also supports postdoctoral research, recruiting fellows to explore topics such as the intersection of biodiversity and renewable energy using methods like evidence synthesis or computational simulation modeling.25 The institute provides various climate education resources for different audiences, including K-12, informal educators, and the public, featuring tools like the Climate Commons interactive map and simulators like C-ROADS and En-Roads.26

RCEI mirrors the interdisciplinary, problem-focused strategy of the RAD Collaboratory but targets climate and energy. The deliberate integration of AI into its grant program theme 24 and the use of computational modeling in its research positions 25 indicate a strategic effort to harness advanced computational and data science methodologies to address climate and energy challenges, likely leveraging institutional resources like OARC and fostering connections with initiatives like RAD.

**SEBS Strategic Plan (2020-2025)**

The School of Environmental and Biological Sciences (SEBS) operates under its own 5-Year Strategic Plan (2020-2025), developed collaboratively by faculty, students, staff, and alumni during a period of leadership transition.12 The plan reaffirms SEBS's vision of contributing to "A Healthy and Sustainable Future..." and its mission focused on "Creating, Disseminating, and Implementing Solutions..." through research, education, entrepreneurship, outreach, and engagement.12

The plan emphasizes a holistic model that recognizes the need for convergence across disciplines to address complex challenges.13 It highlights the importance of modern technological and pedagogical techniques in both classroom and experiential learning settings.13 The core values underpinning the plan are Access (promoting diversity and inclusion), Excellence (pursuing rigorous scholarship reflecting diverse perspectives), and Relevance (addressing critical societal needs).13

While this plan predates the launch of the RAD Collaboratory and RCEI, and thus may lack explicit strategies focused on AI and large-scale data science, its foundational principles create a strong alignment. The emphasis on interdisciplinary approaches, tackling complex environmental and sustainability challenges, and embracing modern technology positions SEBS as a key contributor to university-wide initiatives like RAD and RCEI.12 The "AI for Climate and Biodiversity" faculty cluster hire, involving SEBS 21, directly builds upon the strategic groundwork laid by the school's plan.

## **Research Infrastructure and Support**

Rutgers University provides substantial infrastructure and support services to enable advanced research, particularly in computationally intensive fields. The Office of Advanced Research Computing (OARC) and its primary cluster, Amarel, form the backbone of these capabilities.

**Office of Advanced Research Computing (OARC)**

OARC serves as the central entity providing strategic leadership, expertise, and support for advanced research computing (ARC), encompassing high-performance computing (HPC), data science, and advanced networking across all Rutgers campuses.27 Operating in partnership with the Office for Research, OARC aims to facilitate scholarly achievements by offering essential cyberinfrastructure resources and services.28

Key services provided by OARC include access to HPC clusters like Amarel, research data storage and management solutions, cybersecurity support, advanced networking capabilities (including connections to national infrastructures like XSEDE and OSG), cloud services integration (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud), Geographic Information Systems (GIS) support, visualization platforms, and extensive training and consultation.27 OARC employs Research and Education Facilitators (REFs), who are computational scientists with domain expertise (e.g., biochemistry, data science, genomics, engineering), to assist researchers with leveraging these resources effectively and provide training.30 Training covers topics such as Linux, cluster usage, software management, machine learning, cloud computing, computational genomics, and information security.32 OARC also supports the development of Data Management Plans (DMPs) using tools like DMPTool, often required for funding proposals.33

**Amarel Cluster**

Amarel is Rutgers' flagship HPC cluster, managed by OARC and available to the entire university community.28 Named in honor of Dr. Saul Amarel, a founder of the Rutgers Computer Science Department and AI pioneer, Amarel is designed as a heterogeneous system to support diverse research applications, including traditional HPC, high-throughput computing (HTC), data analytics, and AI/machine learning.28

The cluster operates on a "condominium" model.27 This provides free, shared access to general pooled resources on a first-come, first-served basis for all Rutgers faculty, staff, and students.33 Additionally, researchers or departments can become "owners" by purchasing dedicated nodes, guaranteeing priority access equivalent to their investment, while allowing unused cycles from owned nodes to contribute back to the general pool.27 This model optimizes resource utilization across the university.

As of mid-2024 (prior to the integration of the 'Clark' phase), Amarel comprised approximately 770 compute nodes distributed across data centers in Piscataway, Newark, and Camden.34 The system features a significant number of Intel Xeon cores (over 37,000 reported in 34) and a substantial GPU capacity (248 reported in 34, 190 in 33). GPU types include NVIDIA RTX 2080Ti 36, likely A100s (based on purchase plans 37), and L40S.34 The cluster includes nodes with varying core counts (12-56+) and memory configurations (64GB up to 1.5TB for high-memory nodes).35 Nodes are interconnected via high-speed Mellanox InfiniBand (FDR/EDR) fabric, and the system utilizes IBM Spectrum Scale (GPFS) for its parallel file system.34 User access is facilitated through standard command-line SSH, as well as web-based portals like Open OnDemand and FastX.34 Job scheduling and resource management are handled by SLURM.35

**Table 1: Rutgers Amarel Cluster Hardware Overview (Mid-2024)**

*Note: Specifications reflect information available up to mid-2024 and are subject to change with ongoing upgrades (e.g., 'Clark' phase). GPU counts and types represent a mix acquired over time.*

**C. Software Stack (Amarel)**

Software on Amarel is primarily managed using the Lmod module system, which allows users to load specific versions of compilers, libraries, and applications into their environment as needed.35 OARC maintains core system software and common scientific libraries and tools. A community-contributed software repository also exists, expanding the range of available tools.34

However, users are generally expected to install specialized software, scripts, and libraries within their own /home or /scratch directories.35 OARC provides guidance and support for this process, which typically involves downloading source code, configuring, compiling, and installing, often using standard Linux tools like configure, make, and package managers like pip or conda within user-managed environments (e.g., Python virtual environments).35

While the provided snippets do not contain an exhaustive list of pre-installed AI/ML software on Amarel 34, the cluster's architecture, including significant GPU resources 34 and support for Python 35, is well-suited for such workloads. The expectation that users install their own software 35 means that standard frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, and various R packages for machine learning are likely used extensively by researchers managing their own software environments on the cluster, even if not centrally maintained as modules by OARC. The cluster is explicitly designed to support data analytics and AI applications 28, reinforcing the capability to run these tools.

**D. Data Storage and Management**

Amarel provides several storage tiers to meet different research needs 35:

* /home: User home directories with a default quota (e.g., 100GB), intended for software, configuration files, and essential personal data. This space is backed up weekly but is not optimized for high-performance job I/O.35  
* /scratch: A large, high-performance parallel file system accessible from all nodes within a specific campus (Piscataway, Newark, Camden). It offers significantly larger quotas (e.g., 1TB soft limit) and is the recommended location for running jobs and storing active input/output data. However, /scratch is not backed up, and files may be subject to purging if users exceed quotas for extended periods (e.g., 90 days).35  
* /projects: Shared storage space for research groups or departments, accessible across nodes. Like /home, it is backed up weekly but not intended for active job I/O.35  
* /mnt/scratch: Local disk space available on individual compute nodes. Offers potentially very high speed but is limited in size and is temporary; data must be moved before a job completes.35

Data protection for /home and /projects is enhanced through regular snapshots, allowing users to potentially recover previous versions of files.35 OARC provides tools like mmlsquota for users to monitor their storage usage.35 A variety of data transfer methods are supported, including standard tools like scp and rsync, graphical clients, web-based tools via Open OnDemand, Globus for large transfers, rclone for cloud storage integration (e.g., Box), and direct interaction with cloud buckets (AWS S3, GCP) using command-line tools.35

**Access Policies**

Access to Amarel is generally open and free for all current Rutgers students, staff, and faculty for use of the shared, pooled resources.33 Priority access is granted to "condo owners" who have purchased dedicated nodes.33 External collaborators can gain access via Rutgers Guest NetIDs, typically restricted to using resources owned by their Rutgers sponsor.35 Off-campus access requires the use of the Rutgers VPN.35 While compute time on shared resources is free, purchasing dedicated nodes involves equipment costs, though OARC covers ongoing administration, power, and cooling expenses.33 Rutgers also supports open access scholarship through its institutional repository, SOAR (Scholarly Open Access at Rutgers), allowing researchers to deposit legal copies of their articles at no cost, increasing visibility and impact.38

## **Research and Academic Program Highlights**

Rutgers-New Brunswick offers several avenues for students to specialize in Geographic Information Science (GIS) and related geospatial technologies.

* **Programs:** SEBS offers an undergraduate Certificate and Minor in Environmental Geomatics through the Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Natural Resources.91 The Department of Geography (School of Arts and Sciences) offers an undergraduate Certificate in Geographic Information Science.93 A graduate Certificate in Geospatial Information Science is also available, open to students across graduate programs.94  
* **Curriculum Focus:** These programs provide training in core GIS concepts, remote sensing, spatial analysis, database development, and cartography/visualization.91 Required and elective courses include Fundamentals of Environmental Geomatics (11:573:232/233), Intermediate Environmental Geomatics (11:573:362), Advanced Environmental Geomatics (11:573:462), Introduction to Remote Sensing Image Analysis (11:216:371), Advanced Remote Sensing (11:216:474), Spatial Data Analysis (01:450:320), Geographic Information Systems (01:450:321), Remote Sensing (01:450:322), Principles of Cartography (01:450:355), Advanced GIS (01:450:421), and Spatial Data Visualization and Map Design (11:573:437).91 Quantitative analysis skills are supported through required statistics courses (e.g., 01:960:401).91  
* **Integration and Support:** GIS and remote sensing courses are integrated into environmental curricula, serving as requirements or electives in majors like Environmental Sciences 56 and EENR.8 The Grant F. Walton Center for Remote Sensing and Spatial Analysis (CRSSA), located within SEBS, serves as a key hub for research and education in geospatial technologies, coordinating certificate programs and managing instructional labs equipped with GIS/RS software.51 CRSSA engages in research projects applying geospatial technologies to environmental, agricultural, and natural resource management, such as land use/land cover mapping, coastal resource monitoring, and farmland preservation analysis.51 OARC also provides GIS support services to the broader research community.28

The multiple certificate and minor options, combined with the integration of geospatial courses into relevant majors and the dedicated support from CRSSA and OARC, indicate that GIS and remote sensing are well-established areas of expertise and instruction at Rutgers-New Brunswick. This infrastructure provides essential tools and skills for data-intensive research in environmental science, ecology, planning, and other fields central to the university's strategic priorities.

## **Research Integrity and Governance**

Rutgers University maintains policies and provides training to ensure the ethical conduct of research, addressing traditional areas of research integrity as well as emerging challenges related to data governance and artificial intelligence.

**Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR)**

Rutgers defines Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) as the practice of scientific investigation with integrity, involving the awareness and application of established professional norms and ethical principles.98 Recognizing that several federal funding agencies mandate RCR training, the university has established mechanisms to meet these requirements.98

* **Training Requirements:**  
  * **NIH:** NIH requires RCR instruction at least once per career stage (graduate student, postdoc, faculty) and no less than once every four years for trainees, fellows, and scholars supported by specific NIH grants.98 At Rutgers, this is primarily fulfilled through the School of Graduate Studies (SGS) course 16:115:556 "Ethical Scientific Conduct (Initial Training)" or the refresher course 16:115:558.98 These courses cover NIH-mandated topics such as conflict of interest, human/animal subjects, mentor/mentee responsibilities, safe lab practices, collaborative research, peer review, data acquisition/management/ownership, research misconduct (fabrication, falsification, plagiarism), responsible authorship, and societal impacts of research.99 The format typically involves lectures by content experts followed by small-group case study discussions.100 The initial course (16:115:556) is required for biomedical PhD and MS students but open to postdocs and faculty.100 The refresher (16:115:558) is required for 5th-year PhD students, 3rd-year MD/PhD students, and applicable postdocs/junior faculty.100  
  * **NSF:** All PIs, co-Is, faculty, key persons, postdocs, graduate students, and undergraduate students supported by NSF funding must receive RCR training.98 Rutgers allows this requirement to be met either by taking two in-person courses via the S.P.A.C.E. (Scholarship, Pedagogy, and Continuing Education) program or through online RCR training via the CITI Program.98  
  * **USDA-NIFA:** NIFA requires RCR training for program directors, faculty, students, postdocs, and staff involved in associated research projects.98 Rutgers accepts various in-person and online training options, including CITI RCR courses, workshops, seminars, and specific academic courses, to fulfill this requirement.98  
* **CITI Program:** Rutgers utilizes the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) Program as a primary provider of web-based research education content.103 Access is provided via Rutgers NetID login.103 CITI offers specific RCR modules tailored to different disciplines (Biomedical, Social & Behavioral, Humanities, Physical Science, Engineering, Business/Science).103 Completion of CITI modules is a recognized way to fulfill NSF and NIFA RCR requirements.98 Beyond RCR, CITI is also used for mandatory training in Human Subjects Protection (required for IRB protocols) and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) for NIH-funded clinical trials, as well as optional training in Conflict of Interest, Export Control, and addressing Undue Foreign Influence.103 Researchers can print completion reports from CITI as proof of training.103 Some specific courses, like the CCIB Lab Practices course, also require CITI training completion.104  
* **Course-Integrated RCR:** Several graduate programs incorporate RCR and ethics training within their required coursework, such as Ecology and Evolution (16:215:501 Ethics and Development) 105, Microbial Biology (16:682:530 Scientific Conduct and Ethics), and others.98

**Table 3: Rutgers RCR Training Requirements Summary**

| Funding Source | Required Personnel | Training Method(s) at Rutgers | Frequency/Timing |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **NIH** (Specific Grants) | Trainees, fellows, participants, scholars | SGS Course 16:115:556 (Initial) or 16:115:558 (Refresher) 98 | At least once per career stage (grad, postdoc, faculty); no less than once every 4 years 98 |
| **NSF** | PIs, Co-Is, faculty, key persons, postdocs, graduate students, undergraduate students | Any two S.P.A.C.E. program courses OR Online CITI RCR Training 98 | One-time requirement per individual per award, typically completed early in the project. |
| **USDA-NIFA** | Program directors, faculty, students, postdocs, staff on NIFA projects | Online CITI RCR Training OR other approved workshops, seminars, courses (in-person or online) 98 | Agency requirement; timing may vary. |
| **General/Course** | Varies by program (e.g., all biomedical PhDs require 16:115:556 101) | Specific courses (e.g., 16:115:556, 16:215:501 105), CITI modules (e.g., for CCIB 104), workshops, seminars | Varies by program/course requirements. |

*Note: Researchers should always consult their specific grant terms and departmental/program requirements for precise RCR training obligations.*

**Data Governance and Security**

While the provided materials do not detail a specific, university-wide "Data Ethics Policy" for research distinct from RCR principles, Rutgers addresses data governance and security through several mechanisms:

* **University IT Policies:** General policies govern the use of IT resources and information assets. Policy 70.1.1 outlines Acceptable Use, and Policy 70.1.2 addresses Information Classification (likely covering sensitivity levels like public, sensitive, restricted, similar to frameworks at other universities).106 These provide a baseline for data handling.  
* **RCR Data Management Training:** RCR training explicitly covers data acquisition, record-keeping, retention, ownership, analysis, interpretation, and sharing, instilling ethical principles for data handling within the research context.99  
* **Data Governance Education:** While not a university-wide policy document, the existence of courses touching on data governance, policy, and ethics (e.g., IN200 at Purdue Global, SCLA 52200 at Purdue Online – used here as examples of relevant topics) suggests recognition of these issues within curricula related to data science and IT. The Rutgers Data Science programs, involving multiple schools, likely incorporate data governance principles within their coursework.66  
* **RAD Collaboratory:** Given its focus on large-scale AI and data science research 15, the RAD Collaboratory is implicitly tasked with establishing or adhering to robust data governance practices for the complex datasets it will manage and generate.

The combination of general IT policies, RCR training focused on data, and the emergence of large data science initiatives suggests that while a single, overarching "Data Ethics Policy" for research may not be explicitly documented in these snippets, the principles of responsible data handling, security, and ethical use are addressed through multiple institutional layers.

**AI Ethics**

Rutgers is actively engaging with the ethical dimensions of artificial intelligence through dedicated initiatives, research, and emerging guidelines:

* **AI@Rutgers Initiative:** This university-wide initiative includes a Research Working Group specifically tasked with evaluating the AI landscape in research, developing policies and procedures addressing ethical, legal, and social implications, assessing risks, and promoting AI literacy among researchers and students.107 This indicates a formal process for developing institutional AI ethics guidelines for research.  
* **AI Ethics Lab:** Housed at Rutgers-Camden, this lab focuses on examining AI's ethical and legal implications throughout its lifecycle, from design to monitoring.108 It employs a "solutions scholarship" methodology to develop practical policy strategies for responsible AI. The lab collaborates internationally and engages undergraduate researchers in projects like the AI & Human Rights Index.108  
* **Coursework:** Several courses across different units address AI ethics, including AI, Ethics, and Society (ECE 59500 \- Purdue example), AI Ethics & Responsible Business Practices (Rutgers Exec Ed 110), AI & Society, AI & Vulnerable Humans, AI Ethics & Law (Rutgers-Camden 109), Deconstructing Machine Learning Bias (Rutgers-Newark 82), and potentially elements within Data Governance courses and the RAD Collaboratory's AI for Society research area.15 The required course SCLA 52200 (Artificial Intelligence Policy, Governance, And Ethics) in the new MS in AI program directly addresses these issues.  
* **General Guidance:** Rutgers IT provides resources and initial guidance on AI use, emphasizing responsible practices, bias awareness, transparency, data privacy (especially regarding sensitive data), and adherence to existing university policies like Academic Integrity (10.2.13) and Information Classification (70.1.2).106 They recommend tools like Microsoft Copilot (Enterprise version) and Google Gemini (via ScarletMail) as offering enhanced privacy protections compared to public tools.106

Rutgers' approach to AI ethics appears multifaceted, combining top-down policy development through the AI@Rutgers Research Working Group 107, dedicated research and advocacy via the AI Ethics Lab 108, integration into curricula across various programs, and general awareness-building and guidance through IT resources.106 This reflects a comprehensive strategy to navigate the complex ethical landscape of AI in both research and education.

## **Partnerships, Engagement, and Impact**

Rutgers University–New Brunswick actively fosters collaborations and engages with external partners and the community, translating its research and educational activities into broader societal impact, consistent with its land-grant mission.

## **Conclusion**

Rutgers University – New Brunswick presents a compelling profile as a major research institution actively positioning itself at the forefront of critical 21st-century challenges, particularly in the intersecting domains of environmental science, artificial intelligence, and data science. Its traditional strengths, embodied by the School of Environmental and Biological Sciences (SEBS) and its constituent departments like EENR, provide a deep foundation in ecological understanding, natural resource management, and field-based research, newly bolstered by SAF accreditation for key forestry tracks.8

Layered upon this foundation is a clear and ambitious institutional strategy, articulated through the Academic Master Plan 14 and manifested in significant, cross-cutting initiatives. The $10 million investment in the RAD Collaboratory 15 and the establishment of the RCEI 15 signal a decisive pivot towards interdisciplinary approaches and the integration of advanced computational methods. The RAD Collaboratory, in particular, with its planned faculty cluster hires spanning multiple schools (including SEBS, Engineering, SAS, SCI) 21 and integrated student research programs 16, represents a concerted effort to build a university-wide ecosystem for AI and data science innovation, moving beyond departmental confines.

This strategic direction is enabled by robust research infrastructure managed by OARC, centered around the powerful and flexible Amarel HPC cluster.34 While specific high-level AI/ML software frameworks may not be centrally maintained as modules 34, the cluster's significant GPU capacity 34, support for user-installed software 35, and explicit design for data analytics 34 ensure that researchers have the necessary tools to pursue cutting-edge computational research.

The academic portfolio reflects this convergence. Environmental programs in EENR and Environmental Sciences increasingly emphasize quantitative skills, modeling, and geospatial technologies.8 Concurrently, the university has launched comprehensive, interdisciplinary programs in Data Science at both undergraduate and graduate levels 66, alongside specialized certificates and minors in GIS/Geomatics.91 This curricular evolution ensures a pipeline of talent equipped with the necessary skills to contribute to and benefit from the university's research priorities.

Furthermore, Rutgers demonstrates a commitment to responsible innovation through its focus on research integrity, mandatory RCR training programs 98, and proactive development of AI ethics governance structures and research.107

Looking forward, Rutgers-New Brunswick is well-positioned to carve out leadership niches where its strengths intersect. The explicit focus on "AI for Climate and Biodiversity" within the RAD cluster hires 21 and the RCEI grant theme 24, combined with SEBS's expertise and OARC's computational power, suggests significant potential in applying AI/ML to environmental modeling, biodiversity monitoring, climate prediction, and sustainable resource management. Continued investment in the RAD Collaboratory and OARC infrastructure, successful recruitment of interdisciplinary faculty, and effective integration of data science education across domains will be critical for realizing this potential. Ensuring broad accessibility and utilization of advanced computing resources across all relevant disciplines, alongside the consistent application of robust ethical frameworks for AI and data use, will be key challenges and opportunities as Rutgers-New Brunswick pursues its strategic vision.
