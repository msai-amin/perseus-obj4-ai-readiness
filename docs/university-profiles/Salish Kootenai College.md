# **Salish Kootenai College**

# **Executive Summary**

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of Salish Kootenai College's (SKC) integration of advanced computational methods—including Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), data science, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), modeling, quantitative methods, and High-Performance Computing (HPC)—within its academic programs related to natural resources and environmental science. As a Tribal College serving primarily Native American students and grounded in the cultures of the Séliš, Ksanka, and Qlispe' peoples, SKC presents a unique context for examining the intersection of technology, science, and Indigenous knowledge.

The analysis reveals that SKC offers a robust portfolio of programs within its Division of Natural Resources and Sciences, including Forestry, Hydrology, Wildlife & Fisheries, Life Sciences, and Information Technology, Engineering, & Computer Science (ITECS). These programs successfully integrate foundational quantitative and computational skills, particularly statistics and GIS, into their curricula. GIS appears as a core, cross-cutting competency, supported by dedicated courses and faculty expertise. Statistics is universally required, with the Wildlife & Fisheries program notably incorporating the R programming language. Life Sciences demonstrates a specific strength in bioinformatics.

Faculty expertise aligns with these curricular strengths, with established capabilities in GIS, ecological and hydrological analysis, statistics, and bioinformatics distributed across relevant departments. A significant and unique strength lies in faculty expertise and institutional commitment to integrating Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) with Western science, supported by initiatives like the Indigenous Research Center (IRC). However, expertise in advanced areas like AI and ML appears concentrated within the ITECS department, primarily linked to external research collaborations, such as participation in NSF EPSCoR projects.

Regarding institutional resources, SKC provides standard IT services but lacks evidence of dedicated, centralized HPC resources or broad support for GPU computing. Advanced computational capabilities seem housed within departmental labs (e.g., Life Sciences molecular biology labs, ITECS computer and manufacturing labs). Researchers likely rely on these departmental resources, external collaborations, or cloud computing for intensive computational needs.

SKC's strategic direction, articulated through its mission, vision, and core themes, strongly emphasizes serving Native American students, perpetuating Flathead Nation cultures, and conducting research relevant to community needs and cultural/natural resource preservation. While advanced computation is not an explicit strategic priority in high-level documents, institutional actions like program development (e.g., the MS in Natural Resources Management) and grant participation indicate operational engagement. The integration of technology is guided by its alignment with cultural values and community benefit, with Indigenous Data Sovereignty emerging as a key principle.

The college maintains a formal Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) framework managed by its Institutional Review Board (IRB), which uniquely blends federal compliance (45 CFR 46\) with protocols for protecting CSKT cultural intellectual property, resources, and sovereignty, utilizing CITI for mandatory training. However, a specific institutional policy addressing the ethical use of AI appears absent, representing a potential gap given the increasing prevalence and research involvement in AI.

Overall, SKC demonstrates significant strengths in foundational computational skills within its natural resource programs, coupled with a unique and vital commitment to integrating Indigenous knowledge. Key opportunities lie in leveraging external partnerships and fostering internal collaboration between ITECS and natural resource programs to enhance capacity in advanced computational areas like AI/ML, developing culturally grounded AI ethics guidelines, and potentially investing in more accessible computational resources. Addressing the apparent lack of SAF accreditation for the Forestry program and clarifying pathways for natural resource students to access advanced ITECS coursework are also areas for consideration.

## **I. Academic Landscape: Programs and Computational Curriculum**

Salish Kootenai College (SKC), a tribal college located on the Flathead Indian Reservation in Montana 1, provides post-secondary education grounded in the cultures of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes (CSKT).2 Its academic structure includes several divisions, with the Division of Natural Resources and Sciences serving as the hub for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) programs.4 This section examines the relevant academic departments, program offerings, accreditation status, and the integration of quantitative and computational skills within the curricula pertinent to forestry, environmental science, and related fields.

### **A. Departmental Overview and Program Portfolio**

The Division of Natural Resources and Sciences encompasses a range of departments offering associate, bachelor's, and select master's degrees.4 Key departments relevant to this analysis include Forestry, Hydrology, Wildlife & Fisheries, Life Sciences, Mathematics, and Information Technology, Engineering, & Computer Science (ITECS).4 The General Science program also resides within this division.4

SKC offers several specialized programs focused on natural resource management and environmental science:

* **Forestry:** Provides Associate of Science (AS) and Bachelor of Science (BS) degrees with emphases in Forest Management and Wildland Fire Science.4 The curriculum covers forest ecology, measurement techniques, sustainable management, and wildfire science.4 A distinctive feature is the program's emphasis on the interconnectedness of forests, tribal sovereignty, and cultural preservation, preparing graduates for roles in tribal, federal, and state agencies.7 The program structure allows students to complete an AS degree to qualify as technicians and then continue for a BS degree for professional forester roles or graduate studies.7  
* **Hydrology:** Offers AS and BS degrees, providing an interdisciplinary education in the physical, chemical, and biological aspects of water resources and their management.1 The program description highlights the development of theoretical, conceptual, computational, and practical skills for monitoring, quantifying, and managing water resources, with a specific focus on challenges relevant to Tribal lands and waters.4 SKC's Hydrology program was notably the first of its kind to be accredited at a tribal college or university.1 A central aim is to empower Tribal communities by enhancing understanding and articulation of water-related issues from Indigenous perspectives.7  
* **Wildlife and Fisheries:** Delivers AS and BS degrees focused on the biology, ecology, management, and conservation of fish, wildlife, and their habitats.1 Students gain foundational knowledge at the AS level, while the BS program offers deeper theoretical understanding and research experience, culminating in a required undergraduate senior thesis.4 The program aims to equip students to meet federal hiring standards for related job series and educational requirements for professional certifications from The Wildlife Society and the American Fisheries Society.13  
* **Life Sciences:** This BS program focuses on molecular and cellular biology and chemistry, investigating molecular interactions within living cells.4 Hands-on research is integral, supported by dedicated facilities: the Environmental Chemistry Laboratory (SKC-ECL) and the Cellular and Molecular Biology Laboratory (SKC-CMBL).4 The program offers two senior-year tracks: Cellular Biology and Environmental Health, the latter concentrating on tribal environmental health issues, epidemiology, environmental chemistry, and toxicology.4  
* **General Science:** An AS degree program designed as a flexible entry point for students interested in STEM or intending to transfer to a four-year institution.15 Students in this program are advised by Life Science faculty.16  
* **Mathematics:** The AS in Mathematical Sciences aims to prepare students for bachelor's degree programs in STEM fields requiring a strong mathematical foundation, including statistics and engineering.17  
* **Information Technology, Engineering, & Computer Science (ITECS):** This department offers several pathways, including an AS in Information Technology (focusing on infrastructure, operating systems, networking, security), an AS in Computer Science Transfer Track (emphasizing programming in Python, Java, C, data structures, algorithms, and preparing students for transfer into four-year CS programs), a Certificate of Completion in Computer Programming (providing foundational skills), and a Certificate of Completion in Pre-Engineering.4  
* **Master of Science in Natural Resources Management (MS-NRM):** Launched in Fall 2021, this 60-credit graduate program addresses urgent regional environmental challenges like megafires and watershed contamination stemming from climate change.5 Developed with faculty initiative (Rick Everett) and crucial support from the University of Idaho, the program adopts a systems-based approach encompassing wildlife biology, fisheries, hydrology, fire ecology, and forestry, with a focus on Montana, Northern Idaho, Washington, and Oregon.5 It is delivered via distance learning/synchronous courses, targeting both recent graduates and working professionals seeking advanced expertise.5

This portfolio reflects SKC's commitment to providing comprehensive education in natural resources and related sciences, consistently integrating Tribal perspectives and place-based knowledge.7 The structure within the Division of Natural Resources and Sciences 4 allows for potential interdisciplinary work, as seen in the Hydrology program 4 and the systems-based MS-NRM.5 However, the distinct departmental organization might also present challenges for seamlessly integrating specialized computational skills, particularly those housed within ITECS, into the natural resource programs. The Computer Science AS, for instance, is explicitly designed as a transfer track 19, suggesting its primary orientation is external rather than servicing internal SKC programs with advanced computational training, although its foundational courses could benefit students across disciplines. The MS-NRM program's explicit systems approach may represent an effort to foster greater integration at the graduate level.5

Furthermore, the evolution of programs, such as the development of the MS-NRM from a single class concept in response to regional needs and through external partnerships 5, demonstrates institutional responsiveness and adaptability. There is some ambiguity regarding an "Environmental Science" program; an older source lists it 1, but recent departmental lists do not.4 Current evidence suggests environmental science topics are primarily integrated within the Hydrology and Life Sciences (Environmental Health track) programs.4

**Table 1: Overview of SKC Natural Resource & Related Science Programs**

### **B. Accreditation Status**

Institutional accreditation provides assurance of overall quality, while programmatic accreditation signifies alignment with specific professional standards within a discipline. Salish Kootenai College holds institutional accreditation from the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (NWCCU), with its accreditation reaffirmed in Spring 2021\.1

For forestry programs, the Society of American Foresters (SAF) is the recognized accrediting body in the United States, ensuring degree programs meet established standards of educational excellence.28 In 2020, SKC's forestry program achieved a significant milestone by becoming the first Tribal college to receive SAF-accreditation *candidacy*.29 Candidacy status typically indicates that a program shows promise for meeting accreditation standards and is actively working towards that goal.

However, a review of available SAF accredited program lists 30 and SKC's institutional accreditation information 26 does not indicate that the Forestry program currently holds full SAF accreditation. This suggests that either the candidacy period concluded without achieving full accreditation, the process remains ongoing, or the institution may have shifted its focus regarding this specific programmatic accreditation. The nearby University of Montana does hold SAF accreditation for its forestry programs.30

The absence of full SAF accreditation could potentially affect graduates seeking professional licensure or specific employment opportunities in jurisdictions where graduation from an SAF-accredited program is a prerequisite or confers an advantage. However, SKC's Forestry program places a strong, unique emphasis on preparing graduates for careers within Tribal natural resource management contexts and the surrounding region.6 This focus on culturally relevant, place-based education aligns directly with SKC's mission 2 and may be perceived as more valuable by its target student population and Tribal employers than adherence to national accreditation standards designed for mainstream programs. The decision regarding SAF accreditation may therefore reflect a strategic choice prioritizing SKC's specific mission and community needs.

### **C. Integration of Quantitative and Computational Skills in Curricula**

An examination of available curriculum data reveals the extent to which quantitative and computational skills are integrated into SKC's natural resource and related science programs.

**GIS and Remote Sensing:** Geographic Information Systems (GIS) appear to be a foundational skill within the Natural Resources division. The Wildlife & Fisheries AS degree explicitly requires two GIS courses: NATR334 GIS I: Basic Cartography and Geoprocessing, and NATR354 GIS II: Basic Digitizing & Raster Analysis.32 Faculty expertise in GIS is present in the Forestry department, with Department Head Robert Kenning teaching the subject 33, and a dedicated GIS Instructor, Cody Sifford, is also listed within the division.33 The Hydrology BS program description mentions computational and practical experiences in quantifying water resources 4, and its learning outcomes include demonstrating skills in "basic geospatial analysis".35 An older institutional profile also noted the availability of GIS and Remote Sensing courses at SKC.1 Furthermore, research associated with the Indigenous Research Center utilizes remote sensing and GIS.36 While the specific Forestry BS curriculum snippet available did not list a required GIS course 8, the presence of faculty expertise and the requirement in the closely related Wildlife & Fisheries program strongly suggest GIS is a core competency accessible to, and likely utilized by, Forestry students.

**Statistics and Quantitative Methods:** Statistical literacy is emphasized across multiple programs. The Forestry BS requires MATH342 Statistical Methods 8, and program outcomes include interpreting forest inventory information.6 The Wildlife & Fisheries AS requires MATH241 Statistics and, significantly, NATR242 Introduction to R Statistics.32 The inclusion of R, a powerful open-source language standard in ecological and environmental data analysis, provides Wildlife & Fisheries students with a highly valuable and transferable skill set. The BS outcomes for this program also explicitly mention "data analysis".13 The Life Sciences BS program mandates a substantial mathematics sequence, including MATH241 Statistics and MATH342 Statistical Methods, alongside foundational algebra, modeling, and calculus courses.14 The Hydrology program description refers to "quantifying" water resources 4, and BS outcomes include "computational analysis" 35, implying a strong quantitative component, though specific statistics course requirements were not accessible.37 The AS in Mathematical Sciences prepares students for statistics-intensive fields 17, and the ITECS Computer Science AS includes foundational math through Calculus III.19

**Modeling:** Mathematical modeling concepts are introduced through MATH108 Advanced Functions & Modeling, a course required in both the Forestry BS 8 and Life Sciences BS 14, as well as the Computer Science AS.19 The Hydrology program's reference to "computational" aspects 4 likely encompasses hydrological modeling, although specific course details are unavailable.37 Within Life Sciences, the Bioinformatics courses (LFSC245/445) are expected to involve computational modeling of biological systems.14

**Data Science and Bioinformatics:** Explicit data science training appears primarily within ITECS and Life Sciences. The ITECS Computer Programming Certificate and Computer Science AS include CSCD183 Database Concepts and CSCD186 Introduction to Data Visualization and analysis.18 The Life Sciences BS program features a dedicated two-course sequence in Bioinformatics (LFSC245, LFSC445) 14, reflecting a specific strength in computational biology. This is further supported by faculty research interests in microbe analysis and molecular modeling 38 and presentations on bioinformatics approaches in the department.15 The location of database and data visualization courses within ITECS, particularly given the CS program's transfer focus 19, raises questions about their accessibility and integration for natural resource majors who could benefit from these skills.

*Note: This table is based on curriculum snippets available in the provided research materials. Full degree requirements, particularly for the BS in Hydrology 37, BS in Wildlife & Fisheries 39, and BS in IT 40, as well as details for advanced ITECS courses 41, were inaccessible and represent data gaps.*

### **D. Availability and Accessibility of Advanced Computational Coursework (AI/ML, HPC-related)**

Based on the available curriculum information, dedicated undergraduate courses explicitly focused on Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), High-Performance Computing (HPC), or broadly defined Data Science appear limited or absent within the core requirements of the Forestry, Hydrology, Wildlife & Fisheries, and Life Sciences programs.8 Data gaps exist for the Hydrology and Wildlife & Fisheries BS programs.37

The most likely location for such advanced coursework is the ITECS department. Faculty member Drew Grennell, the department chair, is actively involved in AI/ML research through an external grant 42, and another individual associated with SKC, Al Anderson, participated in an AI panel discussion.44 ITECS offers a course titled CSCD 430 \- ADVANCED TOPICS IN COMPUTING 45, which could potentially cover AI, ML, or related areas, but its specific content and prerequisites were not accessible.41 The accessibility of such a course for students majoring in natural resource fields is unclear and would depend heavily on prerequisites and program structures.

Alternative pathways for students in natural resource programs to engage with advanced computational topics may exist through experiential learning. Options like Independent Study (e.g., ITEC 499, LFSC 499\) or Undergraduate Research (e.g., MATH 480R) could allow motivated students to pursue specialized projects under faculty mentorship.45 The requirement for a senior thesis in the Wildlife & Fisheries BS program 12 and the emphasis on hands-on research in Life Sciences labs 14 and other initiatives like the Climate Hub 46 provide contexts where advanced computational methods might be applied on a project basis, guided by faculty with relevant expertise (e.g., GIS, modeling, bioinformatics).

At the graduate level, the MS-NRM program, with its systems-based approach 5 and research component (NRMG 598\) 45, presents a logical venue for incorporating more sophisticated computational modeling and data analysis. Faculty associated with the program, such as Dr. Chris Frissell 47, possess relevant expertise. The program's distance learning format 5, however, might influence the feasibility of computationally intensive work requiring specific on-campus resources, potentially favoring cloud-based tools or analyses manageable on standard computers.

Therefore, while foundational computational skills are integrated, accessing dedicated, advanced training in AI/ML or HPC within the natural resource programs seems challenging based on current course listings. ITECS holds the primary expertise and potential coursework in AI/ML, but pathways for cross-enrollment need clarification. Project-based learning and graduate studies offer alternative avenues for engagement with these advanced methods.

## **II. Faculty Expertise and Research Ecosystem**

The capacity of an institution to engage in advanced computational research and education is significantly shaped by the expertise of its faculty and the supporting research environment, including centers, initiatives, and collaborations.

### **A. Faculty Research Strengths in Computational and Quantitative Methods**

SKC faculty across several departments possess expertise relevant to computational and quantitative methods in natural resource and environmental science.

**Geospatial Analysis (GIS/Remote Sensing):** Expertise in GIS is evident within the Natural Resources division. Robert Kenning, Forestry Department Head, teaches courses in forest measurement, inventory, and GIS, including spatial analysis.33 His background includes forest biometrics.34 Cody Sifford serves as a dedicated GIS Instructor.33 The Hydrology program outcomes explicitly include basic geospatial analysis.35 Additionally, Ren Freeman, Director of the Indigenous Research Center, utilizes remote sensing and GIS in her research on landscape archaeology and its intersection with Indigenous Knowledge Systems.36

**Hydrology, Environmental Modeling, and Analysis:** The Hydrology department faculty demonstrate strong quantitative and analytical backgrounds. Dr. Chris Frissell holds MS and PhD degrees in Fisheries Science and has extensive research experience and publications concerning watershed and stream channel processes, land/water management impacts, conservation ecology, climate change implications for aquatic biota, environmental assessment, and conservation planning.47 His work inherently involves quantitative analysis and likely ecological or hydrological modeling. Adam Johnson holds an MS in hydrogeology and has professional experience in water resources projects, contaminant assessment/remediation, and developing culturally relevant geosciences curricula; he has authored peer-reviewed articles and technical reports.50 Visiting Tribal Scholar Shanny Spang Gion (affiliated via IRC 36) focused her MS research on integrating TEK and Western Science for water management using hydrogeology and technical communication.36 Former faculty Antony Berthelote was involved in integrating technology and spatial data (potentially including NASA data) into the Hydrology curriculum.52

**Wildlife, Fisheries Ecology, and Analysis:** Faculty in the Wildlife & Fisheries department possess expertise in ecological research and analysis. Department Head Janene Lichtenberg is a Certified Wildlife Biologist with an MS in Biology and prior experience working for CSKT and USGS; her research interests include wildlife habitat relationships and sensitive species conservation, and she has several publications.54 Georgia Smies holds an MS in Zoology and focuses on aquatic ecosystems, TEK integration, and has past research experience evaluating groundwater/surface water interactions and macroinvertebrate assemblages, with current interests in ungulate impacts on stream invertebrates.56 Dr. Chris Frissell also brings deep expertise in fisheries science and ecology.47 Program outcomes emphasize understanding research methods and data analysis techniques.13

**Bioinformatics and Molecular Biology:** The Life Sciences department houses expertise in computationally intensive biological research. Department Head Dr. Christina Rush's research involves characterizing microbial communities (mercury methylating bacteria in Flathead Lake), developing computational models (Hantavirus virus-like-particles), and structural identification of mitochondrial proteins using molecular techniques.38 The department's curriculum includes required bioinformatics courses 14, and its labs support molecular research.14 Dr. Clay Comstock also holds a PhD in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.57

**Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Computer Science:** Explicit AI/ML expertise appears concentrated in the ITECS department. Department Chair Drew Grennell is actively involved as a faculty researcher in the AI/ML component of a multi-institutional NSF EPSCoR project focused on "Smart Fires".42 Al Anderson, affiliated with SKC, participated in a Minority Serving \- Cyberinfrastructure Consortium (MS-CC) panel on AI.44 Other ITECS faculty, like Lee Slater 22, teach foundational computer science topics including programming, databases, and data visualization.18 Dr. Dylan Kloster, listed as faculty in a 2022-2023 catalog 58 but not the 2024-2025 list 57, holds a PhD in Physics 58, a field often reliant on computation.

**Mathematics and Statistics:** The Mathematics department includes faculty with advanced degrees in mathematics (Pauline Dupuis, MS; Dept Chair, MA) and related engineering fields with a focus on quantitative methods (Rob Dhuyvetter, MS Industrial & Management Systems Engineering).57 They support the AS in Mathematical Sciences 17 and teach the statistics courses required by various natural resource programs.8

This distribution suggests that while expertise in established methods like GIS and statistics is fairly well integrated within the natural resource departments, cutting-edge AI/ML expertise resides primarily within ITECS. This structure necessitates cross-departmental collaboration for applying the most advanced computational techniques to natural resource problems. Furthermore, the involvement of faculty like Drew Grennell in major external research projects 42 highlights the importance of leveraging partnerships to access and contribute to advanced computational research domains. A unique and critical area of strength across departments is the expertise in integrating TEK with Western scientific approaches 36, offering a distinct perspective for environmental research and potentially novel applications of computational tools.

### **B. Key Research Centers, Initiatives, and Projects**

SKC hosts several centers and initiatives that form a crucial part of its research ecosystem, often serving as platforms for student training, faculty research, and the application of computational methods, frequently in collaboration with external partners.

* **Center for Tribal Research and Education in Ecosystem Sciences (TREES):** This center focuses on providing hands-on internship opportunities in natural resources for tribal students.61 Internships span forestry, wildland fire, archaeology, botany, wildlife, fisheries, and hydrology, placing students with agencies like the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) nationwide.62 TREES aims to foster culturally driven natural resource research relevant to tribal communities and develop the workforce in these fields.61 This emphasis on experiential learning provides a practical context for students to apply skills, potentially including computational techniques learned in coursework, to real-world problems.  
* **Climate Learning Hub:** Led by Wildlife & Fisheries Department Head Janene Lichtenberg, this hub aims to centralize learning and information sharing about climate change, emphasizing CSKT knowledge and local community needs.64 Its activities include research, such as a study on elk behavior and vegetation dynamics at the CSKT Bison Range 46, and outreach, like a children's book on pollinators and huckleberries integrating Salish seasonal knowledge.65 While the Hub's description doesn't explicitly detail the use of advanced computational methods like climate modeling or AI 64, the nature of climate change research and ecological studies often involves significant data analysis, modeling, and potentially GIS/remote sensing, suggesting a likely need or application of such tools.  
* **Indigenous Research Center (IRC):** The IRC supports research grounded in Indigenous Research Methods (IRM).36 Notably, the Director's research investigates the impacts of remote sensing technologies and GIS on Indigenous Knowledge Systems (IKS) and tribal decision-making regarding cultural and natural resources.36 The IRC also engages with critical topics like Indigenous Data Sovereignty.36 This center represents a unique space at SKC focused on the ethical and effective integration of modern research technologies within Indigenous cultural frameworks.  
* **Life Science Research Laboratories:** The Environmental Chemistry Laboratory (SKC-ECL) and the Cellular and Molecular Biology Laboratory (SKC-CMBL) are integral to the Life Sciences program, offering paid internships and research opportunities for students.4 Research activities include microbial analysis, development of virus models using computational techniques (VPLs), and protein identification 38, indicating the use of sophisticated laboratory and potentially computational methods, including bioinformatics.15  
* **ITECS Laboratories and Initiatives:** The ITECS department manages the Advanced Manufacturing and Innovation Lab (AMIL), a makerspace providing training and access to equipment like 3D printers, CNC routers, and laser cutters.22 While focused on fabrication, AMIL develops skills in computational design (e.g., SolidWorks 66) and could potentially support the creation of custom environmental sensors or research tools. The department also maintains computer labs with modern equipment, supports a High Altitude Rocket Team involved in data acquisition and analysis for NASA-related projects, and anticipates opening an MSGC BOREALIS Lab.22  
* **Externally Funded Projects and Partnerships:** SKC actively participates in collaborative research funded by external agencies. Examples include the NSF EPSCoR "Smart Fires" project involving AI/ML research 42, broader support from the NSF Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) for STEM education and research 65, the partnership with the University of Idaho to develop the MS-NRM program 5, and potential integration of NASA data in Hydrology studies.53 The Sloan Indigenous Graduate Partnership supports the IRC Director's research.36 These collaborations are vital for accessing resources, expertise, and funding for advanced research endeavors.

### **C. Interdisciplinary and Collaborative Research Indicators**

Interdisciplinary approaches and collaborations are evident throughout SKC's research and academic structures. The Hydrology program is explicitly interdisciplinary 4, and the MS-NRM program adopts a systems-based perspective integrating multiple natural resource fields.5

Faculty often work across departmental lines or engage with external entities. For instance, Adam Johnson collaborates with CSKT tribal departments on water resource and environmental projects 50, and Chris Frissell holds roles in both the Hydrology department and the graduate program.48

External partnerships are particularly prominent and appear crucial for advancing research capacity, especially in computationally intensive areas. The collaborations with the University of Idaho for the MS-NRM program 5 and participation in the multi-institutional NSF EPSCoR AI/ML project 43 exemplify how SKC leverages external relationships to develop new programs and engage in cutting-edge research. The TREES program's reliance on partnerships with federal agencies (USFS, BIA) for internship placements further underscores this strategy.61

While these collaborations and interdisciplinary programs demonstrate connectivity, there appears to be an opportunity for enhanced internal synergy, specifically between the natural resource programs and the ITECS department. Leveraging the AI/ML expertise being developed within ITECS 42 for application to the complex ecological, hydrological, and forestry challenges studied within the Natural Resources division could yield significant benefits. Currently, explicit examples of such internal collaborations applying advanced ITECS computational skills to natural resource problems were not prominent in the reviewed materials, suggesting this is an area with potential for growth, perhaps facilitated through graduate research within the MS-NRM program or targeted interdepartmental initiatives.

## **III. Institutional Resources for Computational Research**

The availability and accessibility of computing infrastructure, software, and specialized support services are critical for enabling computationally intensive research and education.

### **A. Overview of IT Services and General Computing Support**

SKC's IT Services department, housed in the A. Mathias Building, provides the foundational technology infrastructure and support for the campus community.67 Its stated functions include protecting digital information and infrastructure, managing technology purchasing and repair, supporting educational technology devices, and maintaining network connectivity.67

Standard services offered include a Help Desk, management of digital accounts (including SKC Google Workspace for email, calendar, and cloud storage via Drive; the JICS/ECampus portal; Brightspace Learning Management System; and Papercut print management), campus WiFi access, support for classroom technologies like Promethean boards and video conferencing, website hosting, and security awareness training (KnowBe4).67 IT Services also maintains policies related to Technology Purchasing, Technology Management, and Data Access & Security.67

The focus of these services, as described, centers on maintaining general campus operations, ensuring network security, and supporting standard administrative and educational technology needs.67 There is no explicit mention within the general IT Services descriptions of dedicated support tailored to the specific needs of computationally intensive research, such as assistance with specialized scientific software installation and use, management of large research datasets, or operation of advanced computing hardware. This suggests that researchers requiring such specialized support may need to rely on departmental resources, external collaborations, or the standard Help Desk infrastructure.

### **B. High-Performance Computing (HPC) and Advanced Computing Capabilities (GPU, Software)**

A thorough review of the provided materials yielded no evidence of dedicated, centralized High-Performance Computing (HPC) resources at Salish Kootenai College. Pages detailing academic research infrastructure are currently under construction 69, and descriptions of central IT services lack any mention of HPC clusters or support.67 Similarly, there is no indication of generally accessible Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) for research computation, which are often essential for accelerating AI/ML workloads.

Furthermore, no information was found regarding a centrally managed research software stack, particularly for common AI/ML frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) or specialized simulation and modeling packages beyond those potentially available in specific departmental labs (like GIS software, R, or programming environments within ITECS).

The apparent absence of on-premise HPC or readily available GPU resources strongly suggests that SKC researchers undertaking computationally demanding tasks likely rely on alternative solutions. These may include leveraging computational resources provided by external collaborators through grants (such as the NSF EPSCoR project involving AI/ML 43), utilizing commercial or academic cloud computing platforms (potentially funded through grants or departmental budgets), or working within the limits of resources available in departmental computer labs or on individual workstations. The distance-learning format of the MS-NRM program 5 might also steer graduate research towards methods feasible without on-campus HPC access.

### **C. Specialized Laboratories Supporting Computational Work**

While centralized research computing resources appear limited, SKC possesses specialized departmental laboratories that support specific types of computationally relevant work.

* **Life Sciences Laboratories:** The Environmental Chemistry Lab (SKC-ECL) and the Cellular and Molecular Biology Lab (SKC-CMBL) provide critical infrastructure for the Life Sciences program.4 These labs facilitate hands-on student research and utilize techniques like PCR 14, supporting research in areas like microbial community analysis and molecular modeling, which inherently involve data analysis and potentially bioinformatics software.15  
* **ITECS Laboratories:** The ITECS department operates the Advanced Manufacturing and Innovation Lab (AMIL), a makerspace equipped with 3D printers, CNC machines, and laser cutters.22 This lab supports training in design software (e.g., SolidWorks 66) and computational fabrication. While primarily focused on manufacturing, AMIL's capabilities could potentially be applied to develop custom hardware, such as environmental sensors or specialized research apparatus, relevant to natural resource studies. ITECS also maintains standard computer labs described as having "modern equipment," presumably supporting programming, data visualization, and other tasks related to the department's curricula.22 The upcoming MSGC BOREALIS Lab 22 and the data analysis activities of the High Altitude Rocket Team 22 further indicate departmental engagement with data-intensive projects.

These departmental labs represent important pockets of computational capability. Life Sciences is equipped for bioinformatics and molecular data analysis, while ITECS supports programming, data visualization, and digital fabrication. This decentralized structure underscores the reliance on departmental resources for specialized computational work in the apparent absence of central facilities.

## **IV. Strategic Priorities and Alignment**

An institution's strategic direction, as articulated in its mission, vision, and planning documents, provides context for understanding its priorities regarding technology adoption, research focus, and curriculum development.

### **A. Analysis of SKC's Mission, Vision, and Core Themes**

Salish Kootenai College's institutional identity and purpose are clearly defined in its official statements. The **Mission** centers on providing quality post-secondary education and support for Native Americans, perpetuating the specific cultures of the Séliš, Ksanka, and Qlispe' peoples of the Flathead Nation, and impacting the community through service and research.2 The **Vision** aspires for SKC to be the pre-eminent educational center for American Indian students, grounded in these specific Tribal cultures, empowering students to improve community well-being through research, leadership, and service.2

These are operationalized through four **Core Themes**: Access and Success (providing higher education access for Native Americans), Quality Education (for workforce or further study), Cultural Perpetuation (sustaining CSKT cultures), and Research and Service (promoting community health, preserving cultural/natural resources, fostering civic participation).2 The institutional values are further reflected in the "Four Cs": Communication, Critical Thinking, Citizenship, and Cultural Awareness, with Cultural Awareness explicitly emphasizing the sustaining of living Séliš, Qĺispé, and Ksanka traditions.2

These foundational documents establish a clear framework: SKC's primary commitment is to its Native American students and the perpetuation of Flathead Nation cultures, with education, research, and service designed to support these goals and benefit the community, particularly concerning cultural and natural resources.2

While advanced computational methods like AI, data science, or HPC are not explicitly mentioned in these high-level statements, their role can be inferred. The commitment to "quality education" in STEM fields necessitates incorporating contemporary tools and methodologies, including computational approaches.2 Likewise, impactful "research and service" focused on complex "natural resource" issues increasingly relies on data analysis, GIS, modeling, and other quantitative techniques.2 Furthermore, the emphasis on "Critical Thinking" 2 aligns with the analytical skills required for computational problem-solving and data interpretation. Therefore, while not a named strategic priority itself, computational capacity appears implicitly necessary as a *means* to achieve SKC's core mission and vision in the 21st century.

However, the profound emphasis on cultural grounding 2 suggests that decisions regarding the adoption and application of technology, including advanced computation, are likely evaluated through a cultural lens. The alignment with cultural values, potential impacts on the community, and relevance to Tribal priorities probably take precedence over pursuing technology solely for its novelty or perceived prestige. This cultural anchor shapes SKC's unique approach to science and technology.

### **B. Evidence of Strategic Focus on Technology, Data Science, or Computational Research**

Beyond the foundational mission and vision, specific strategic plans detailing priorities for technology or computational research were not available in the provided materials, although a policy for an Institutional Planning Process exists.3 The core institutional statements do not single out technology, data science, or AI as distinct strategic thrusts.2

Despite this lack of explicit high-level strategic focus, SKC demonstrates *operational* engagement with technology and computation through various actions. The existence of the ITECS department with its computer science and IT programs 4, the development of the MS-NRM program which includes computational aspects in its description and faculty expertise 4, the creation of specialized labs like AMIL 22, and active participation in externally funded research involving AI/ML 42 all point to institutional activity and investment in these areas.

This suggests that SKC's strategy regarding advanced computation might be implemented more through specific, often grant-funded, initiatives or program developments rather than being driven by an explicit, top-down mandate articulated in the primary mission or vision statements. This approach allows for flexibility and responsiveness to opportunities but could potentially benefit from a more explicit institutional strategy. Lacking clear strategic prioritization in core documents might pose challenges in securing sustained internal funding, building cohesive cross-campus capacity, and consistently guiding future development in advanced computational areas beyond project-specific goals.

### **C. Role of Indigenous Knowledge in Science and Technology Strategy**

Indigenous knowledge and cultural context are not peripheral but central to SKC's identity and approach to science and technology. The mission explicitly includes perpetuating CSKT cultures 2, and Cultural Awareness is a core institutional value.2 This commitment permeates the natural resource programs, which emphasize the relationship between ecological systems, tribal sovereignty, and cultural preservation.7

This integration is embodied by faculty who possess expertise in bridging TEK and Western science 50 and by research entities like the IRC, which focuses on Indigenous Research Methods and explores the complex interactions between technology (like GIS) and Indigenous Knowledge Systems.36 The principle of Indigenous Data Sovereignty—the right of Indigenous peoples to govern the collection, ownership, and application of their own data—is a topic of active discussion.36 Furthermore, the institutional research ethics framework explicitly mandates the protection of cultural resources and respect for tribal sovereignty.70

This deep integration of Indigenous perspectives represents a significant institutional strength and offers a unique niche for SKC in the broader landscape of scientific research and education. It allows the college to address environmental and natural resource issues from a holistic viewpoint that values long-term, place-based knowledge alongside conventional scientific data. There is considerable potential to leverage computational tools to analyze, visualize, and integrate TEK and scientific datasets in culturally appropriate ways, contributing novel insights to resource management and conservation.

However, the centrality of cultural protocols and data sovereignty also means that the adoption and use of technology, particularly powerful data-intensive tools like AI, are subject to careful ethical scrutiny. The principles of tribal control, access, benefit-sharing, and potential impacts on cultural resources are paramount considerations.36 This ethical lens, while crucial, may influence the pace and nature of technology adoption, ensuring it aligns with community values rather than simply following external trends.

## **V. Research Ethics and Governance**

Robust ethical frameworks and governance structures are essential for ensuring responsible research practices, particularly in institutions working closely with specific communities and cultural knowledge.

### **A. Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) Framework**

Salish Kootenai College maintains a formal structure for overseeing the ethical conduct of research, centered on its Institutional Review Board (IRB).70 The IRB's mandate covers all research involving human subjects conducted under SKC's auspices, requiring review and approval *before* any research activities commence.70 This process ensures compliance with ethical and legal standards.

SKC's RCR framework operates under a distinctive dual structure. It adheres to the federal regulations outlined in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Code of Federal Regulations Title 45 Part 46 (the "Common Rule") for the protection of human subjects.70 Simultaneously, and with equal importance, the IRB process incorporates specific considerations pertinent to research involving the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes. These include the protection of cultural intellectual property, safeguarding cultural and natural resources, ensuring community well-being, demonstrating respect for elders and community strengths, and upholding and promoting tribal sovereignty.70 This integration signifies a commitment to ethical standards that encompass both universal principles of human subjects protection and specific Tribal values and rights.

To facilitate this culturally grounded review, the IRB may consult with the Salish and/or Kootenai Culture Committees, and researchers might be required to obtain explicit written permission from the relevant Culture Committee or tribal government authority as part of the IRB protocol submission.70 The SKC President retains authority to overrule IRB decisions concerning cultural or other Tribal resources.70

Training is a mandatory component of this framework. All researchers involved in human subjects research or work potentially impacting cultural resources must complete training in human subjects protection and cultural intellectual property.70 IRB members themselves are required to complete this training, specifically utilizing the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI Program).70 CITI Program offers comprehensive online modules covering core RCR topics such as authorship, data management, research misconduct, conflicts of interest, and protections for human and animal subjects, aligning with training requirements often mandated by federal funding agencies like NSF and NIH.72 The use of CITI ensures that researchers and reviewers have a foundational understanding of standard RCR principles.71

### **B. Policies Addressing AI Ethics and Data Governance**

While SKC has established policies for general academic integrity and data security, specific institutional guidelines addressing the unique ethical challenges posed by Artificial Intelligence (AI) were not identified in the provided materials. The existing Plagiarism Policy emphasizes academic honesty and proper attribution of sources but does not explicitly mention AI-generated content.74 While its principles could be broadly applied, it may not fully capture the nuances of authorship, transparency, bias, and accountability associated with AI tools (as outlined in example guidelines from other institutions 75).

Similarly, while IT Services maintains a Data Access & Security Policy 67, its specific provisions regarding the governance of research data, particularly data used for or generated by AI systems, are unknown.

The absence of a dedicated AI ethics policy represents a potential gap, particularly given faculty involvement in AI research 42 and the increasing accessibility and use of AI tools in academia.44 Clear guidelines would help students and faculty navigate the responsible use of AI in coursework and research, ensuring integrity and addressing potential biases or privacy concerns.

However, SKC demonstrates significant awareness of data governance issues within its specific context through discussions facilitated by the Indigenous Research Center on Indigenous Data Sovereignty.36 This principle, which asserts the rights of Indigenous peoples to control data relating to them and their resources, is also reflected in the IRB's mandate to protect cultural resources and tribal sovereignty.70 This focus suggests that any future development of AI ethics or broader data governance policies at SKC would likely be strongly informed by principles of Indigenous Data Sovereignty, ensuring alignment with tribal self-determination and community values.

### **C. Integration of Cultural Protocols and Indigenous Data Sovereignty**

The integration of CSKT cultural protocols and the principles of Indigenous sovereignty is a hallmark of SKC's research governance. This is not merely a passive consideration but an active component of the formal review process. The IRB's explicit mandate to consider impacts on cultural intellectual property, cultural/natural resources, community well-being, and tribal sovereignty—including potential consultation with and required approval from CSKT Culture Committees—institutionalizes cultural accountability within the research enterprise.70

This proactive integration ensures that research conducted under SKC's auspices is vetted for alignment with Tribal values and governance structures. The work of the Indigenous Research Center in promoting Indigenous Research Methods and exploring Indigenous Data Sovereignty further reinforces this commitment at both practical and theoretical levels.36

This careful, culturally grounded approach is essential for ethical research in an Indigenous context. However, it may present challenges when interacting with rapidly evolving technologies like AI and ML. The need for thorough review and potential community consultation to ensure cultural appropriateness 70 must be balanced with the pace of technological advancement. Maintaining this balance requires ongoing dialogue, adaptive governance mechanisms, and continued leadership from entities like the IRC to navigate the complex intersection of cutting-edge technology, research ethics, and Indigenous self-determination.

### **B. Recommendations for Enhancing Computational Capacity and Integration**

Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are proposed to strategically enhance SKC's capacity and integration of computational methods within its natural resource and environmental science domains:

1. **Conduct a Comprehensive Needs Assessment:** Perform an internal assessment across natural resource and ITECS departments to identify specific needs and priorities for research computing resources (HPC, GPU, cloud credits), specialized software, and faculty/student training in advanced computational methods (AI/ML, data science, advanced modeling).  
2. **Develop Accessible Pathways to Advanced Computation:** Explore mechanisms to make relevant ITECS courses (e.g., data visualization, database concepts, potentially advanced topics) more accessible to natural resource students, perhaps through tailored prerequisites, bridge modules, or cross-listed electives. Investigate integrating computational modules directly into existing natural resource courses.  
3. **Foster Targeted Interdisciplinary Collaboration:** Create formal opportunities (e.g., seed grants, joint seminars, working groups) to encourage collaboration between ITECS faculty with computational expertise and natural resource faculty/students working on data-intensive environmental problems. Focus initially on areas with existing overlap, such as applying AI/ML to fire ecology or geospatial data.  
4. **Prioritize Cloud Computing and Partnerships:** Given potential constraints on acquiring on-premise HPC, strategically prioritize securing access to cloud computing resources through grants, institutional partnerships (e.g., with regional universities or cyberinfrastructure consortia like MS-CC), or vendor agreements tailored for academic research. Continue leveraging external research collaborations (like NSF EPSCoR) to access specialized resources and expertise.  
5. **Develop Culturally Grounded AI Ethics and Data Governance Guidelines:** Initiate a campus-wide process, led perhaps by the IRC and involving the IRB, Culture Committees, faculty, and students, to develop clear institutional guidelines for the ethical use of AI and data governance. These guidelines should be explicitly grounded in the principles of Indigenous Data Sovereignty and CSKT cultural protocols.  
6. **Integrate Computation into Strategic Planning:** Advocate for the explicit inclusion of goals related to building computational capacity (infrastructure, personnel, curriculum) within future iterations of SKC's institutional strategic plan, linking these goals directly to the core mission of providing quality education and impactful research for the community.  
7. **Clarify Forestry Accreditation Status:** Determine the current status and future plans regarding SAF accreditation for the Forestry program and communicate this clearly to prospective and current students, outlining the implications for career pathways.  
8. **Invest in Faculty Development:** Provide opportunities for faculty across disciplines to enhance their computational skills and learn about emerging methods (e.g., workshops on AI applications in environmental science, advanced statistical modeling, research data management).
