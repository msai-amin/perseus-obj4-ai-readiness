* **SIUE:** The Graduate School oversees the RCR Training Policy.96 An RCR Resources webpage provides guidance and materials, likely including CITI Program access.92 SIUE explicitly addresses the specific RCR training requirements of major federal funders like NSF (requiring mentor training, mentorship plans, and Individual Development Plans (IDPs) for graduate students/postdocs), NIH (requiring at least 8 hours of instruction with face-to-face interaction every four years across specific topic areas), and USDA NIFA.96 Resources emphasize mentorship and provide tools like mentoring agreements.92 Policies on research misconduct (1Q5) and plagiarism (1I6) are also in place.96  
* **CITI Program:** As a widely adopted platform, CITI offers comprehensive online courses covering core RCR topics such as authorship, collaboration, conflicts of interest, data management, human subjects research, mentoring, peer review, plagiarism, and research misconduct.97 Its use at SIUC 89 and likely integration into SIUE's resources 92 provides a standardized baseline for RCR education across the system.

These frameworks ensure that SIU researchers are trained in the fundamental ethical principles governing research, aligning with federal mandates and promoting a culture of integrity.

**B. AI Ethics Landscape**

The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence presents new ethical considerations for universities. SIU is actively engaging with these issues, though a formal, system-wide AI-specific ethics policy was not identified in the reviewed materials.

* **Teaching and Learning:** SIUC's Center for Teaching Excellence (CTE) is a key resource, exploring AI's potential in education while addressing challenges.99 CTE provides guidance on using AI tools for tasks like lesson planning and feedback, alongside strategies for detecting AI-generated content in student work and promoting academic integrity through alternative assessment methods.99 This indicates a proactive approach to supporting faculty and students in navigating AI in the classroom.  
* **Campus Dialogue:** SIUC has hosted events like the Student Speakers Forum specifically focused on AI and humanity, fostering discussion on ethics, creativity, bias, and societal impact.100  
* **Faculty Research:** Specific faculty are engaged in AI ethics research. **Mohammad Khoshroo** (SIUE Philosophy) investigates AI ethics, AI aesthetics, and the ethical requirements of autonomous systems.56 Research in Computer Science implicitly involves ethical considerations in the development and application of AI systems.78  
* **Existing Policies:** While not AI-specific, existing policies on academic integrity, plagiarism 96, and the general SIU System Code of Ethics and Conduct provide a foundation.101 How these apply to AI-generated content may require further clarification or specific institutional guidance.

Currently, SIU appears to be addressing AI ethics through departmental resources (like CTE), faculty expertise, and campus conversations, rather than a top-down, comprehensive policy. This allows for flexibility but may lead to inconsistencies until more formal guidelines are established.

**C. Alignment with Strategic Research Goals (Imagine 2030\)**

SIU's research infrastructure, faculty expertise, and governance structures show strong alignment with the Research & Innovation and Sustainability pillars of the "Imagine 2030" plan.2

* **Supporting Research & Innovation:** The R1 designation 1, investment in the BigDawg HPC cluster 83, specialized labs 11, and the dedicated RCC support services 82 directly facilitate the plan's goal of fostering discovery and knowledge creation. Faculty research employing advanced computational methods like AI/ML, HPC, data science, and modeling across various disciplines (CS, Engineering, ESS, Forestry) embodies this innovation.55  
* **Advancing Sustainability:** The strong academic programs and research in Forestry, Geography, Geology, Environmental Resources & Policy, and Environmental Sciences directly address environmental challenges and promote sustainable practices.4 The application of computational tools like GIS, remote sensing, environmental modeling, and GeoAI within these fields is crucial for developing effective sustainability solutions.55  
* **Ensuring Integrity:** The established RCR framework and ongoing engagement with AI ethics provide the necessary foundation of responsible conduct to support the integrity and credibility of the university's expanding research enterprise, crucial for maintaining R1 status and achieving strategic goals.56

The university's operational activities, infrastructure development, and faculty research demonstrate tangible progress towards the aspirations outlined in "Imagine 2030," particularly in leveraging computational power and interdisciplinary approaches to address research and sustainability challenges.

## **Conclusion**

Southern Illinois University, particularly its Carbondale campus, presents a compelling profile as an R1 research institution with significant strengths at the intersection of environmental/natural resource sciences and computational research. Guided by the "Imagine 2030" strategic plan, SIU is actively investing in research, innovation, and sustainability.2

Key assets include robust academic programs in Forestry, Earth Systems and Sustainability (Geography, Geology, ERP), Computer Science, and Engineering, many with specialized tracks and relevant accreditations (SAF, ABET).4 Faculty expertise is notable in areas like forest ecology, fire science, hydrology, wildlife management, GIS/remote sensing, climate science, geoinformatics, HPC, AI/ML, and data science, with evidence of interdisciplinary collaboration through programs like the ERP Ph.D. and centers like C-PAN and the GeoFEW lab.14

The BigDawg HPC cluster serves as a cornerstone of the university's research infrastructure, providing substantial computational power, including GPU resources, with a notably accessible usage policy supported by the dedicated RCC group.82 This infrastructure is critical for enabling advanced computational research across disciplines.

SIU maintains established frameworks for Responsible Conduct of Research, utilizing CITI training and addressing federal requirements.89 The university is also actively engaging with the ethical implications of AI, primarily through educational resources and faculty initiatives, although formal institutional policies specific to AI appear to be still developing.56

Looking forward, SIU is well-positioned to further leverage its strengths. Continued integration of computational methods (AI/ML, advanced modeling, Big Data analytics) within its strong environmental and natural resource programs presents a significant opportunity. Formalizing interdisciplinary initiatives in areas like environmental data science or computational sustainability could enhance visibility and impact. Developing clear, university-wide guidelines on the ethical use of AI in research and academics will also be crucial. Overall, SIU demonstrates a strong foundation and clear strategic direction for continued growth as a leader in research and innovation, particularly in addressing complex environmental and sustainability challenges through integrated computational and disciplinary expertise.
