The comprehensive structure of the Urban Forestry program, spanning B.S. to Ph.D. with specialized concentrations and minors, coupled with its pioneering SAF accreditation, positions SUBR as a premier institution for education and research in the management of urban and community forest ecosystems. The integration of geospatial technologies and quantitative methods within the curriculum reflects an adaptation to modern natural resource management practices.

### **B. Environmental Science & Toxicology Programs**

Unlike institutions with a dedicated Department of Environmental Science, SUBR appears to address environmental science education and research through a more distributed model, leveraging expertise within several departments across two colleges.9

**Department of Environmental Toxicology:** Housed within the College of Sciences and Engineering (CSE), this department offers a Ph.D. program focused on the adverse effects of environmental contaminants on biological systems and the environment.9 It is described as the only program of its kind in Louisiana.29 Research specializations include molecular reproductive toxicology and cell biology, toxicological effects of priority toxic chemicals, chemical evaluation of toxic substances, and microbial remediation of environmental contaminants.29 Faculty expertise encompasses areas such as pulmonary immuno-toxicology, effects of environmental toxicants (e.g., second-hand smoke), molecular mechanisms of toxicity, intermediary metabolism, and the use of animal models in toxicological research.32

**Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering:** Also within CSE, this department offers a B.S. in Civil Engineering.9 While a dedicated environmental engineering degree is not explicitly mentioned in the snippets, the department name implies expertise in this area. Faculty CVs, where available, provide insights; for example, Dr. Chukwu Onu's profile indicates expertise in sustainable solid waste management, water and wastewater analysis, and oil spill research and development.36

**Urban Forestry \- Environmental Studies Concentration:** Within the College of Agricultural, Human and Environmental Sciences, the B.S. in Urban Forestry offers an Environmental Studies concentration.17 Relevant courses include Environmental Science (UFOR 271B), Environmental Leadership, Communication, and Ethical Perspectives (UFOR 392B), Environmental Ethics (UFOR 394B), Natural Hazards and Disasters (UFOR 396B), and Environmental Ecology (UFOR 398B).19

**Other Related Programs:** The Plant & Soil Sciences concentration within the B.S. in Agricultural Sciences focuses on agronomy, environmental soil science, and horticulture, addressing concerns like farmland preservation and conservation of land, soil, and water resources.30

This distributed approach allows SUBR to tackle environmental issues from multiple perspectives – toxicological, engineering, ecological, and agricultural – likely leveraging the specific strengths and research interests of faculty within established departments rather than centralizing them under a single environmental science umbrella.

### **C. Department of Computer Science**

The Department of Computer Science, part of the College of Sciences and Engineering (CSE) 9, offers Bachelor of Science (B.S.) and Master of Science (M.S.) degrees.39 The B.S. program holds accreditation from the Computing Accreditation Commission (CAC) of ABET, a key indicator of program quality in computing fields.31

**Department of Agricultural Sciences:** Offers a B.S. degree with several concentrations, including Plant & Soil Sciences.10 This concentration focuses on agronomy, environmental soil science, horticulture, farmland preservation, crop production, and the conservation of land, soil, and water resources.30 Research and studies in this area address environmental concerns related to agricultural practices.30

**Department of Human Sciences:** Formerly the Department of Family and Consumer Sciences, this department offers a B.S. degree with concentrations including Human Nutrition and Food.10

These programs, particularly Plant & Soil Science, provide potential avenues for interdisciplinary research and collaboration focusing on sustainable agriculture, food systems, environmental health, and resource management, complementing the work done in Urban Forestry and Environmental Toxicology.

## **Research Infrastructure and Computational Resources**

SUBR supports its research and academic activities through a combination of on-campus facilities and access to state-level cyberinfrastructure.

### **A. High-Performance Computing (HPC)**

Southern University's primary access to large-scale HPC resources is through its membership in the Louisiana Optical Network Initiative (LONI).47 LONI connects major research institutions across Louisiana via a high-speed fiber optic network, enabling access to shared supercomputing facilities.52

**LONI Resources:** At the time the source material was generated, LONI's flagship system accessible to SUBR researchers was Queen Bee 2 (QB2), located in Baton Rouge. QB2 was described as a 1.5 Petaflop cluster with 504 compute nodes, 960 NVIDIA Tesla K20x GPUs, and over 10,000 Intel Xeon processing cores.47 *It is important to note that HPC systems evolve rapidly, and the current status and specifications of LONI resources should be verified through LONI directly.* SUBR faculty and students may also gain access to LSU's HPC resources, such as the SuperMIC cluster (described as having 360 nodes, each with two 10-core processors and 64 GB RAM), via special permission.47

**Access Policies:** Access to LONI/LSU HPC resources is managed through a formal user account and allocation system, overseen by the LSU HPC Resource Allocation Committee (HPCRAC).53 Principal Investigators (PIs)—typically faculty, permanent research staff, or approved postdoctoral researchers—apply for allocations of computational time (measured in Service Units, SUs).53 These allocations are generally machine-specific, awarded for one-year periods, and function like bank accounts that authorized users draw upon.53 Startup allocations can be requested anytime, while larger Research allocations have quarterly deadlines.53 Users must have an email address from a LONI institution and adhere strictly to security protocols, including password protection and a prohibition on account sharing.54 Job scheduling is managed through various queues, including checkpoint and preemptible queues that offer access to potentially larger node counts but carry the risk of job termination.53

**On-Campus Facilities:** The Department of Computer Science maintains an on-campus HPC Lab equipped with workstations suitable for modeling, preliminary code testing, and intermediate-sized jobs. This lab also includes a 32 TB fiber-connected storage system for handling large datasets.47 This facility serves as a local resource and a gateway to the larger LONI systems.47

SUBR's reliance on LONI provides access to substantial computational power without the institutional burden of maintaining a large-scale supercomputer independently. However, this model necessitates that researchers navigate the LONI/LSU allocation processes and policies, potentially impacting research agility due to queue times and allocation limits.

### **B. Key Research Labs and Centers**

Beyond HPC, SUBR hosts several labs and centers supporting research in environmental and computational sciences:

**Computer Science Research Labs:** The CS department lists several research focus areas and associated labs, including: Information Assurance (IA Center), Robotics, Machine Learning & Applied Big-data, Sensor Networks, Bioinformatics, and Software Engineering.39 A High Performance Data Processing Laboratory equipped with Dell servers and workstations supports computational approaches and big data analytics.47 These labs directly align with the department's academic concentrations and faculty expertise, providing infrastructure for specialized research.

**SU ANSWERS Institute:** The Institute for Air, Nutrient, Soil, Water, Ecosystem, and Remote Sensing, led by Dr. Zhu Hua Ning from Urban Forestry, focuses on environmental monitoring and analysis, likely leveraging GIS and remote sensing capabilities within the Urban Forestry department.7

**Urban Forestry Research:** Research within the Urban Forestry department covers a broad spectrum, including urban forest structure and function, carbon sequestration, air and water quality analysis, climate change impacts, GIS and remote sensing applications, wetlands, nanotechnology, and bioenergy.1

**Other Facilities:** The university provides general computer labs (e.g., T.T. Allain, Smith-Brown Union, Library) with internet access and standard software.57 The CS department utilizes a Solaris Lab with Sun Ray thin clients.47 A Network Lab supports network monitoring and maintenance activities.47 Specialized Electronic Classrooms across campus are equipped for lecture capture.59

The existence of these specialized labs, particularly within Computer Science and linked to Urban Forestry via the SU ANSWERS Institute, indicates a capacity for sophisticated, computationally intensive research in areas central to the university's strategic priorities.

### **C. IT Services and Research Support**

General information technology support for the campus is provided by the Division of Information Technology (DoIT), which manages network infrastructure, wireless access, IT security policies, Microsoft Office 365 accounts, and password management services.58 The SU Ag Center has its own Technology and Network Services department providing similar functions tailored to the Ag Center's needs, including managing LAN security, servers, and a dedicated helpdesk.61

Access to standard software, such as Microsoft Office 365, is provided to students, faculty, and staff.58 Specialized research software is available within specific departmental labs (e.g., the CS HPC Lab has VASP, MedeA, CHARMM, AMBER) or through the LONI system (e.g., Fluent, Abaqus, Matlab, Mathematica, ANSYS).47 The provided documentation does not indicate a centralized research computing support group dedicated to assisting researchers with advanced software, code optimization, or data analysis beyond the support offered by LONI staff or within individual departmental labs. This suggests a potentially decentralized model where researchers rely more heavily on lab-specific resources, LONI support channels (54), or grant-funded personnel for specialized computational assistance.

## **Research Governance and Integrity**

SUBR operates under established policies for research administration and academic conduct, though specific documentation regarding RCR and AI ethics was limited in the provided materials.

### **A. Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR)**

The provided documents, including the Office of Sponsored Programs (OSP) Manual index and strategic plans, do not explicitly detail a university-wide policy or mandatory training program for Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR).62 General principles of ethical conduct are mentioned in strategic plans and academic integrity policies.4 However, federal funding agencies like the National Science Foundation (NSF), National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)—all sources of funding for SUBR projects (8 \- *SIUC*41)—typically mandate RCR training for students and personnel supported by their grants.69 Programs like the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) are commonly used by universities to fulfill these requirements.69 While collaborating institutions like LSU utilize CITI and offer RCR workshops 73, the specific mechanism for ensuring RCR compliance at SUBR is not outlined in the available snippets. It is probable that RCR training is handled at the departmental or individual grant level to meet federal requirements, or that formal policies exist but were not captured in the source materials. The OSP Manual (62) would be the most logical location for such institutional policies, but its content on this topic was not provided.

### **B. Academic Integrity Policies**

SUBR maintains formal policies addressing academic integrity, primarily through the Student Code of Conduct and specific Academic Dishonesty guidelines.64 Academic dishonesty is defined broadly to encompass cheating (e.g., unauthorized use of materials or assistance), plagiarism (presenting others' work as one's own), falsification of information or documents, gaining unfair advantage, and unauthorized access to records.64 Procedures for addressing violations typically begin with the course instructor, who can assign penalties up to an "F" for the course, with repeated offenses potentially leading to suspension or expulsion.64 A separate academic grievance procedure allows students to appeal academic decisions they believe are unfair, though this process explicitly excludes academic dishonesty findings.78

Notably, the reviewed SUBR policies on academic integrity do not explicitly mention Artificial Intelligence (AI) or the use of generative AI tools like ChatGPT.64 This contrasts with evolving practices at other institutions, such as the University of Southern Mississippi (USM) and Southern Utah University (SUU), which are implementing syllabus statements outlining permissible or prohibited uses of AI.85 State-level guidance for K-12 education on AI use is also emerging in Louisiana.88 While SUBR's existing definitions of plagiarism and cheating could be interpreted to cover unauthorized AI use, the lack of specific language may create ambiguity for students and faculty. This suggests an area where policy clarification may be needed as AI technology becomes more integrated into academic workflows.

### **C. AI Ethics Framework**

Similar to the academic integrity policies, the provided documents do not reveal a specific, university-wide policy or set of guidelines addressing the ethical considerations of using Artificial Intelligence in research or teaching at SUBR. General university ethics matters fall under the purview of the Southern University System Office for Compliance.89 While SUBR is engaged in AI-related research and educational initiatives (e.g., SU-CoDE program, funded research in CS, collaborations with LSU) 67 \- *SIUC*41, a formalized framework specifically for AI ethics appears absent or undocumented in these sources. Ethical review for AI-related research likely occurs within existing structures like the Institutional Review Board (IRB) for human subjects research or through grant-specific compliance requirements, but dedicated guidance on issues like algorithmic bias, data privacy in AI models, or responsible AI deployment is not evident. This contrasts with institutions establishing AI task forces or specific policies (92). As AI becomes more pervasive, developing such a framework may become increasingly important.

### **D. Research Administration**

Research administration at SUBR is structured through two primary offices:

**Office of Research and Strategic Initiatives (ORSI):** This office provides high-level administrative management and supervision for all research programs and centers at the university. Led by the Vice Chancellor for Research, ORSI facilitates strategic planning for research, identifies funding opportunities, supports faculty in securing and managing grants, promotes technology transfer, and fosters partnerships.96

**Office of Sponsored Programs (OSP):** Operating under ORSI, the OSP serves as the central coordinating unit for the lifecycle of sponsored projects. Its responsibilities include assisting faculty with proposal development and submission, coordinating the acquisition of grants and contracts, monitoring awards for compliance with sponsor regulations and university policies, managing modifications, and overseeing project close-out.62 The OSP acts as the intermediary between funding agencies and PIs and ensures adherence to federal, state, and foundation guidelines.62 An OSP Manual provides detailed procedures for these processes.62

This established structure provides essential support for faculty seeking and managing external research funding, ensuring compliance with administrative and regulatory requirements.

## **Strategic Initiatives and Vision**

SUBR's direction is guided by overarching university and college-level strategic plans, as well as specific grant-funded initiatives and collaborations.

### **A. University Strategic Plan (Imagine 20K: 2018-2030)**

The university's primary strategic plan, "Imagine 20K: 2018-2030," outlines a vision for achieving greater national and international prominence.2 It establishes broad goals centered on student access and success, academic excellence, institutional effectiveness and accountability, scholarly research and discovery, fundraising, infrastructure development, branding/partnerships, and technology enhancement.2 Goal IV specifically targets "Scholarly Research, Discovery and Entrepreneurship," aiming to contribute new knowledge.2 Goal VIII, "Commitment to Enhance Campus Technology," focuses on improving digital infrastructure, wireless access, and online processing, along with digital marketing efforts.2 While research and technology are clear priorities, the available overview of the Imagine 20K plan does not explicitly single out AI, data science, or high-performance computing as distinct strategic initiatives at the highest institutional level.2 These areas likely fall under the broader umbrellas of research, discovery, and general technology enhancement, with specific strategies potentially residing at the college or departmental level.

### **B. College-Level Strategic Goals**

Strategic plans at the college level provide more specific direction for research and academic programs:

**College of Sciences and Engineering (CSE):** CSE's strategic plan (referenced for 2018-2023) emphasizes maintaining infrastructure, ensuring high-quality programs, increasing student success, and faculty/staff development.98 Crucially, it identifies "Computation, communication, and information" and "Energy and the environment" as strategic areas for research focus.4 The college aims to align with national research priorities, including fostering collaborations, enhancing STEM diversity, and promoting sustainability.4 Recent reports indicate success in securing over $25 million in grants supporting research in areas including advanced materials, renewable energy, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence.67 This demonstrates a clear commitment within CSE to advancing computational and environmental research.

**College of Agricultural, Human and Environmental Sciences (CAHES):** The strategic plan for CAHES (formerly CAFCS, covering 2018-2024) is themed "Fulfilling the Land-Grant Mission: Teaching, Research and Extension".6 It prioritizes preparing students for global careers, conducting applied and basic research on pressing issues, and delivering extension services, particularly to limited-resource populations.6 Key program areas for research and extension include Sustainable Agricultural Systems, Urban Forestry and Natural Resource Management, Human Nutrition/Family Sciences, Economic/Community Development, and Youth Development.5 The plan acknowledges the transformative impact of the digital economy and artificial intelligence on the job market, suggesting an awareness of the need to integrate relevant skills.6 This plan strongly aligns the college's activities, including the prominent Urban Forestry program, with SUBR's Land-Grant identity.

These college-level plans translate the university's broader goals into more focused research thrusts, with CSE explicitly targeting computation and CAHES emphasizing its Land-Grant mandate through programs like Urban Forestry and Sustainable Agriculture.

A standout feature is the Department of Urban Forestry, Environment, and Natural Resources. Its comprehensive B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. programs, coupled with the pioneering SAF accreditation for its B.S. degree, establish SUBR as a national leader in this specialized field.16 The curriculum's integration of ecology, management, policy, and geospatial technologies prepares graduates for diverse careers addressing critical urban environmental challenges.1

Environmental science education, while not centralized in a single department, is addressed through specialized programs like the Ph.D. in Environmental Toxicology and concentrations within Urban Forestry and potentially Civil & Environmental Engineering.9 This distributed model leverages existing departmental strengths but may require students seeking a broad environmental science background to navigate across different units.

The Computer Science department demonstrates significant adaptation to current technological demands, offering ABET-accredited programs with concentrations in high-growth areas like Data Analytics & Science and Cybersecurity.31 Supported by dedicated labs for machine learning, big data, and HPC access, and bolstered by initiatives like SU-CoDE and collaborations with LSU on HPC software development, the department shows a strong commitment to computational research and education.45

SUBR's research infrastructure relies heavily on external resources, particularly the LONI network for high-performance computing.47 While this provides access to significant computational power, it also means dependence on state-level infrastructure and adherence to external access policies.53 On-campus labs supplement these resources, particularly in Computer Science and Urban Forestry.7

Research governance appears robust in terms of grant administration through ORSI and OSP.62 Standard academic integrity policies are in place.64 However, the provided documentation lacks specific details on institutional RCR training protocols, despite the likelihood of compliance due to federal funding mandates.62 Furthermore, explicit institutional policies addressing the ethical use of Artificial Intelligence in research and academics seem underdeveloped compared to emerging practices elsewhere, representing an area for potential future policy development.85

Strategically, SUBR aims for national prominence through broad goals outlined in its Imagine 20K plan.2 College-level plans provide more specific direction, with CSE targeting computation and environment, and CAHES focusing on its Land-Grant mission through agriculture and natural resource programs.4 Successful grant acquisition and collaborations, particularly with LSU and federal agencies, demonstrate progress towards these goals and provide vital resources and opportunities.8

In conclusion, Southern University and A\&M College leverages its unique HBCU Land-Grant identity to offer specialized, high-quality programs, most notably its nationally leading Urban Forestry department. It possesses growing capabilities in computational fields, supported by access to significant HPC resources via LONI and active research labs. While its research governance structures are established, formal policies regarding RCR training and AI ethics could benefit from further clarification or development. SUBR's strategic direction and active collaborations position it to continue making significant contributions to research, education, and community service, particularly in areas related to environmental sustainability and computational science relevant to Louisiana and beyond. Further investigation into the specifics of RCR implementation, the evolution of AI policies, and the extent of computational modeling within engineering and toxicology could provide a more complete picture of the university's capabilities.
