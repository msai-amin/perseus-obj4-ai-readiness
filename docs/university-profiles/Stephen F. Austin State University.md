# **An Assessment of Artificial Intelligence Integration in Forestry Research at Stephen F. Austin State University**

## **Introduction**

This report assesses the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques within the research activities of core faculty associated with the Society of American Foresters (SAF)-accredited Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Forestry program at Stephen F. Austin State University (SFA), housed within the Arthur Temple College of Forestry and Agriculture. The analysis focuses on faculty holding Assistant, Associate, or Professor ranks and reviews their research output from approximately 2018 to 2025\.

The B.S. in Forestry program at SFA maintains SAF accreditation, a key indicator of educational quality meeting professional standards.1 The core faculty analyzed represent a range of expertise, including significant strengths in geospatial science, quantitative forestry/biometrics, forest ecology, fire ecology, hydrology, and forest management.4

Overall, the integration of AI within the forestry faculty's research portfolio is characterized as **emerging, with notable strengths concentrated in specific areas and among particular faculty members**. There is a strong foundation in advanced data acquisition and analysis using geospatial technologies (GIS, remote sensing, drones).5 Building upon this, key faculty contributors, notably Dr. Yuhui Weng and Dr. Yanli Zhang, demonstrate the application of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques, particularly for predictive modeling, forest attribute estimation using LiDAR and drone imagery, and tree species classification.10 Advanced quantitative modeling, including econometric analysis, is also present.14

Identified strengths lie in the application of established ML/DL tools within geospatial analysis and forest biometrics. Potential gaps include the limited evidence of widespread AI adoption across all forestry sub-disciplines represented by the faculty (e.g., fire ecology, hydrology, entomology) and a primary focus on applying existing AI methods rather than developing novel AI algorithms tailored to specific forestry challenges. The program possesses considerable potential to leverage its existing geospatial and quantitative strengths to foster broader and deeper AI integration 

**Context:** The fields of forestry and natural resource management are increasingly influenced by the rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI encompasses a suite of computational techniques, including machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), computer vision, advanced data analytics, optimization algorithms, and sophisticated predictive modeling. These tools offer powerful capabilities to address long-standing and emerging challenges in the sector, such as understanding complex ecological dynamics, predicting forest responses to climate change, optimizing resource allocation for sustainable management, enhancing wildfire modeling and prediction, improving the efficiency of forest operations, monitoring biodiversity, and analyzing vast datasets generated by remote sensing technologies like LiDAR and Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS, or drones).

**Rationale:** Evaluating the extent to which AI techniques are integrated into the research programs of academic forestry departments is crucial. Such assessments provide valuable information on current research trajectories, highlight areas of strength and potential growth, enable benchmarking against peer institutions, and inform strategic decisions regarding curriculum development, faculty recruitment, and research infrastructure investments.

* **Dr. I-Kuai Hung (Professor):** Dr. Hung's profile highlights expertise in Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.4 His recent research, often in collaboration with Drs. Unger, Kulhavy, and Zhang 5, heavily emphasizes the use of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS, or drones) for data acquisition and the generation of geospatial products like orthomosaics and point clouds.5 Applications include assessing drone positional accuracy over time 6, quantifying mistletoe in urban trees 5, measuring building heights from point clouds 5, 3D modeling of cultural heritage sites 5, and general integration of drones into the curriculum.5 While these activities involve advanced data capture and processing technologies fundamental to many AI workflows, the available information for the 2018-2025 period 5 does not explicitly mention the use of machine learning, deep learning, or other AI *analytical* techniques for interpreting these data. The focus appears centered on photogrammetric methods and UAS operational analysis.  
  * *AI Assessment:* **Low/Adjacent.** Research leverages technologies (UAS, point clouds) that generate data suitable for AI analysis, but direct application of AI/ML methods for analysis within the assessed timeframe is not evident from the provided sources.  
* **Dr. Daniel R. Unger (Professor):** Dr. Unger's expertise lies in Geospatial Science and Remote Sensing.4 His research involves applying remote sensing and GIS to inventory, map, monitor, and manage natural resources.7 Similar to Dr. Hung, a significant focus is on integrating drone technology into both research and curriculum 7, alongside traditional field-based measurements and quantitative assessments.7 Collaborations with Drs. Hung, Kulhavy, and Zhang are frequent.6 Publications mention topics like integrating drones, positional accuracy, quantifying resources, and measuring tree attributes using various methods.7 The available CV 7 and publication snippets 7 do not explicitly detail the use of AI or ML analytic techniques within the target timeframe. The emphasis remains on data acquisition, GIS application, and quantitative field methods.  
  * *AI Assessment:* **Low/Adjacent.** Strong focus on geospatial data acquisition and application, providing potential inputs for AI, but limited evidence of employing AI/ML for data analysis in recent work.

Specific examples include using **machine learning** algorithms like **gradient boosting** and **random forests** to predict stand attributes (e.g., basal area, volume) in loblolly pine plantations using LiDAR and other data sources.11 Furthermore, **deep learning** methods have been applied for measuring loblolly pine crowns using drone imagery.12 Other work involves traditional growth and yield modeling, site index modeling, and analyzing genetic parameters.43 He collaborates with other faculty, including Oswald, Stovall, Hung, and Grogan.11 The CV link was inaccessible.46  
  * *AI Assessment:* **High/Applied.** Dr. Weng's research explicitly incorporates and applies contemporary **Machine Learning** (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) and **Deep Learning** techniques for predictive modeling and analysis of forest inventory attributes using remote sensing data. This represents a significant and direct integration of AI into forest biometrics research.  
* **Dr. Anusha Shrestha (Assistant Professor):** Dr. Shrestha specializes in Forest Economics, with a focus on nonindustrial private forest landowners (NIPF), forest fuel management, valuation of nonmarket services, and GIS applications.14 Her research employs **econometric models** to analyze landowner behavior, such as willingness-to-pay for prescribed burning or willingness-to-accept compensation for ecosystem services.14 Studies investigate factors influencing landowner concern about wildfire and the adoption of fuel reduction treatments.14 GIS is used as a tool in natural resource management analysis.24 Her CV confirms expertise in econometric modeling and GIS.24  
  * *AI Assessment:* **Low/Adjacent.** The research utilizes advanced quantitative methods, specifically **econometric modeling**, which involves sophisticated statistical analysis and prediction relevant to economic behavior.14 While powerful, these methods are typically distinct from the core algorithms often categorized under AI/ML (like neural networks or support vector machines). No explicit use of ML/DL terminology was found in the provided snippets.18 The work is adjacent to predictive analytics but appears rooted in established econometric frameworks.  
* *Quantitative Cluster Synthesis:* This cluster showcases different facets of advanced quantitative analysis. Dr. Weng is actively applying modern ML and DL techniques to forest measurement and modeling challenges, particularly integrating remote sensing data.11 Dr. Shrestha employs rigorous econometric modeling to address economic and policy questions related to forest landowners and management.14 This indicates strength in quantitative methods overall, with Dr. Weng being the primary driver of AI/ML adoption within this specific pairing.

Other Core Forestry Faculty:  
This group encompasses faculty with expertise across various foundational forestry disciplines.

* **Dr. Matthew McBroom (Professor, Associate Dean):** Specializes in Forest Hydrology, Water Quality, and Watershed Management.4 His research interests align with these areas.16 He has collaborated with Dr. Zhang on developing web-based spatial decision support systems 10, which may involve underlying modeling or data analysis components, although specific AI techniques are not detailed.  
* **Dr. Brian Oswald (Professor):** Focuses on Fire Ecology.4 His research includes studies on flammability, prescribed burning effects, and collaboration on growth and response studies involving fire.8 No explicit mention of AI/ML for fire modeling or analysis was found in the available snippets.  
* **Dr. Jeremy Stovall (Professor):** Expertise covers Dendrology, Forest Ecophysiology, and Silviculture.4 Research includes site index modeling 35, pine growth responses to environmental factors and treatments 43, and forest regeneration assessment using statistical methods like the Mean Distance Method.39 No direct AI/ML applications were identified in the snippets.  
* **Dr. David Kulhavy (Professor):** Specializes in Forest Entomology.4 His work involves insect ecology and management, often integrating drone technology for monitoring purposes.6 While drone data can feed into AI analyses (e.g., computer vision for pest detection), the snippets do not confirm Dr. Kulhavy is performing such analyses himself.  
* **Dr. Hans Williams (Professor, Dean):** Research interests include Forest Ecology, Urban Forestry, and Wetland Ecology.4 Collaborates on studies involving ecological responses and pine growth.8 No AI/ML methods were explicitly mentioned.  
* **Other Assistant/Associate Professors (Antoniazzi, Colopietro, Eversole, Forbes, Glasscock, Kidd (Rebecca), Lu, McDonald, Rashall, Stephens Williams):** The faculty directory 4 lists these individuals but provides limited detail on their specific recent research activities or methodologies within the available snippets. Dr. Rebecca Kidd co-authors work on plant responses 43, and Dr. Pat Stephens Williams focuses on Human Dimensions 4, collaborating on drone curriculum integration.7 Without further publication data, assessing AI integration for this group is difficult.  
* *AI Assessment (Group):* Based on the reviewed materials, there is minimal evidence of direct AI/ML application within the research programs of most faculty in this diverse group during the 2018-2025 timeframe. Their research appears to rely primarily on established disciplinary methods (ecological field studies, physiological measurements, traditional statistical analysis, social science surveys, hydrological measurements, entomological surveys).  
  * *Integration Level:* **None Detected / Low/Adjacent** for the majority in this group, based on available evidence.  
* *Synthesis for Other Faculty:* While core forestry research is actively pursued across disciplines like ecology, fire, hydrology, entomology, silviculture, and human dimensions, the adoption of AI/ML analytical tools seems limited within these specific areas at SFA, according to the reviewed data. This presents a significant opportunity. The rich datasets generated (e.g., fire behavior data, hydrological monitoring, insect population dynamics, ecophysiological responses, human dimension surveys) could potentially yield deeper insights or improved predictions if analyzed using ML, DL, computer vision, or natural language processing techniques. Fostering collaborations between these domain experts and faculty with AI/ML skills (like Weng and Zhang) could unlock new research avenues.

## **Program-Level Synthesis of AI Integration**

**Overall Assessment:** The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) within the research landscape of the core faculty associated with Stephen F. Austin State University's B.S. in Forestry program can be characterized as **emerging but concentrated**. While the faculty collectively possesses strong foundational capabilities in data acquisition and quantitative analysis, the explicit application of advanced AI and machine learning (ML) techniques appears primarily driven by a subset of faculty members, particularly within the domains of forest biometrics and geospatial analysis.

**Areas of Strength:**

* **Geospatial Data Acquisition and Analysis:** The program exhibits significant strength in utilizing modern geospatial technologies. Faculty in the geospatial cluster (Hung, Unger, Zhang) demonstrate extensive use of GIS, remote sensing, and particularly drone (UAS) technology for data collection, mapping, and monitoring across various forestry and environmental contexts.5 This proficiency in generating high-resolution spatial and temporal data provides a robust foundation upon which advanced AI analytical techniques can be built.  
* **Application of ML/DL in Remote Sensing & Biometrics:** A clear area of strength is the application of specific ML and DL methods by Dr. Yuhui Weng and Dr. Yanli Zhang. Dr. Weng utilizes ML algorithms like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, along with DL, to predict forest stand attributes and measure tree crowns using LiDAR and drone imagery.11 Dr. Zhang applies DL for classifying tree species from UAV imagery and employs advanced computational methods for analyzing LiDAR point clouds.10 This demonstrates a capacity to leverage AI for enhanced forest inventory, measurement, and classification tasks using remotely sensed data.  
* **Advanced Quantitative Modeling:** Beyond specific AI/ML algorithms, the faculty demonstrates capability in other forms of sophisticated quantitative analysis. This includes the econometric modeling employed by Dr. Shrestha to understand landowner behavior and value ecosystem services 14, as well as the statistical modeling used in growth and yield studies, site index development, and regeneration assessments by faculty like Dr. Stovall and Dr. Weng.35 This broader quantitative expertise complements the more specific AI applications.

**Potential Gaps/Areas for Development:**

* **Broader Adoption Across Disciplines:** The analysis indicates that the explicit use of AI/ML techniques is not yet widespread across all forestry disciplines represented within the core faculty. While geospatial science and biometrics show clear integration points, evidence for AI application in areas such as fire ecology (Oswald), forest hydrology (McBroom), forest entomology (Kulhavy), silviculture/ecophysiology (Stovall), and human dimensions (Stephens Williams) appears limited based on the reviewed data from 2018-2025. These fields represent significant opportunities for applying predictive modeling, computer vision, and advanced analytics.  
* **Focus on Application vs. Development:** The current AI-related research appears primarily focused on *applying* existing ML and DL algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, standard DL architectures for classification) as tools to address specific forestry problems, such as prediction or classification using remote sensing data.10 There is less evidence in the reviewed materials to suggest a focus on the *development* of novel AI methodologies or algorithms specifically tailored to the unique complexities and data structures found in forestry and environmental science.  
* **Leveraging Internal Expertise:** While collaborations exist, particularly within the geospatial cluster 6, there seems to be potential for increased internal collaboration to bridge the AI gap. The expertise of faculty like Dr. Weng and Dr. Zhang in applied AI/ML could potentially be leveraged more effectively by faculty in other disciplines who generate rich datasets suitable for such analyses (e.g., fire behavior data, long-term ecological monitoring data, insect survey data).

**Key Faculty Contributors:** Based on the evidence reviewed for the 2018-2025 period, **Dr. Yuhui Weng** 11 and **Dr. Yanli Zhang** 10 emerge as the key faculty members currently driving the application of explicit AI (ML/DL) techniques within the program's research. Their work demonstrates the practical use of these methods for prediction and classification in biometrics and remote sensing. The foundational work in advanced data acquisition and processing by **Dr. I-Kuai Hung** 5 and **Dr. Daniel R. Unger** 7 is also crucial, providing the necessary high-quality data inputs that enable AI applications.

**Programmatic View:** Stephen F. Austin State University's B.S. in Forestry program, through its faculty, possesses significant assets in geospatial data science and quantitative analysis. The current integration of AI/ML is promising but appears concentrated. A strategic focus on fostering broader adoption of AI tools across different forestry disciplines, potentially through internal workshops, collaborative seed grants, or targeted recruitment, could significantly enhance the program's research capacity and impact. Building upon the existing strengths in data acquisition and the demonstrated success of AI applications by key faculty presents a clear pathway for future growth in this rapidly evolving area.

## **Conclusion**

This report aimed to assess the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) within the research activities of core faculty associated with the SAF-accredited B.S. in Forestry program at Stephen F. Austin State University's Arthur Temple College of Forestry and Agriculture, focusing on the period 2018-2025.

The analysis confirms that SFA offers an SAF-accredited B.S. in Forestry program 1, supported by a diverse faculty with expertise spanning geospatial science, biometrics, ecology, management, fire, hydrology, entomology, and economics.4 The overall level of AI integration within faculty research during the assessment period is characterized as emerging, marked by concentrated strengths rather than widespread adoption. Key faculty members, particularly Dr. Yuhui Weng and Dr. Yanli Zhang, are actively applying machine learning and deep learning techniques, primarily for predictive modeling and classification tasks using remote sensing (LiDAR, drone imagery) and biometric data.10 This application-focused AI work is built upon a strong institutional foundation in advanced geospatial data acquisition (drones, remote sensing) and GIS analysis, notably within the research programs of Drs. Hung, Unger, and Zhang.5

While these specific applications represent significant progress, the analysis also suggests opportunities for growth. Expanding the use of AI tools into other core forestry disciplines represented by the faculty and potentially fostering research into novel AI method development could further enhance the program's research portfolio. Leveraging the existing strong capabilities in data acquisition and the demonstrated success of applied AI by key faculty provides Stephen F. Austin State University with a solid platform for advancing its research contributions in the increasingly data-driven and computationally intensive field of forestry.
