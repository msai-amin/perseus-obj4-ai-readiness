**A. Context: Texas A\&M University's Leadership in Environmental and Natural Resource Sciences**

Texas A\&M University (TAMU), a distinguished land-, sea-, and space-grant institution, possesses a long-standing and profound commitment to advancing knowledge and application in agriculture, natural resources, and environmental stewardship.1 This commitment is deeply rooted in its land-grant heritage and mission to serve the state of Texas, the nation, and the world through education, research, and service.3 The university's extensive reach and impact are exemplified by Texas A\&M AgriLife, a collective encompassing the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (COALS), Texas A\&M AgriLife Research, Texas A\&M AgriLife Extension Service, Texas A\&M Forest Service, and the Texas A\&M Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory. This network employs over 5,000 individuals and maintains a presence in every county of Texas, uniquely positioning it to address complex challenges and deliver science-based solutions.8 TAMU hosts a wide array of academic programs relevant to environmental and natural resource sciences distributed across multiple colleges, including COALS and the College of Arts & Sciences (which now incorporates programs formerly under the College of Geosciences).2 This broad institutional framework underscores TAMU's significant capacity and dedication to these critical fields.

**B. The Computational Imperative in Modern Environmental Science**

Addressing contemporary environmental and natural resource challenges—such as climate change impacts, biodiversity conservation, sustainable resource management, ecosystem restoration, and understanding human-environment interactions—increasingly demands the application of sophisticated computational methodologies.1 The sheer volume and complexity of environmental data generated from sensors, remote sensing platforms (satellites, drones), genomic sequencing, and field observations necessitate advanced tools for analysis, interpretation, and prediction. Artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), data science, geographic information systems (GIS), remote sensing (RS), high-performance computing (HPC), and ecological modeling are no longer peripheral tools but have become integral to scientific discovery and effective management in these domains.27 These computational approaches enable researchers and practitioners to analyze vast datasets, identify complex patterns and correlations, develop predictive models for ecological processes and environmental change, optimize resource allocation and management strategies, and create powerful visualizations to communicate findings and support decision-making.29 The integration of these technologies represents a paradigm shift, allowing for more quantitative, data-driven, and predictive approaches to understanding and managing the Earth's systems.
