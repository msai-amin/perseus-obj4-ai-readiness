His expertise is stated to include "machine and deep learning, and big data analytics," "advanced geo-information science and earth observation," remote sensing, and sUAS/drones.5 This focus is reflected in his recent publications and projects. He utilizes the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform extensively.6 Specific applications include employing various machine learning algorithms (Random Forest (RF), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Gradient Tree Boosting (GTB), Support Vector Machine (SVM)) combined with multi-source data (GEDI LiDAR, satellite imagery, topographic data) to estimate and map forest aboveground biomass (AGB).6 He has also developed automated approaches using ML and GEE for generating high-resolution (1-meter) forest canopy cover datasets 6 and applied deep learning for wetland vegetation classification.51 Further work involves mapping and monitoring drought patterns using GEE 8 and applying ML for predicting soil properties.6 His teaching responsibilities in GIS, Remote Sensing, and Advanced Geospatial Analysis also align with this research focus.5 Dr. Zurqani's work represents a significant hub of modern geospatial AI activity directly applicable to forestry and natural resource management challenges.  
* Robert L. Ficklin (Professor & Associate Dean): Moderate/Adjacent Integration  
  Dr. Ficklin's primary expertise lies in forest biology, forest soils, and ecophysiology.16 His research interests include spectral modeling for soil property analysis.16 Recent work demonstrates engagement with AI, specifically a 2024 conference paper titled "Applications of Machine Learning Techniques in Predicting Selected Soil Properties In Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley Green Tree Reservoir," co-authored with Dr. Zurqani and Dr. Osborne.16 This indicates the application of ML, likely using spectral or other environmental data, to address core questions within his soil science domain. While other recent work focuses on silvicultural impacts and wetland restoration without explicit AI mentions 16, the adoption of ML for soil property prediction signifies an integration of advanced data-driven techniques into his research program. The integration appears focused on utilizing ML as a powerful analytical tool within soil science rather than developing novel AI methodologies.  
* Douglas C. Osborne (Professor): Moderate/Adjacent Integration  
  Dr. Osborne is a wildlife ecologist with a focus on waterfowl ecology, wetland management, and movement ecology.21 His connection to AI integration stems from recent collaborative work applying advanced techniques to habitat assessment. He co-authored a 2024 conference paper on "Deep Learning-Based Wetland Vegetation Classification: The Impact of Spectral and Spatial Features".78 This application of DL is likely aimed at improving the classification and mapping of wetland habitats crucial for the species he studies. His research also involves remote sensing for assessing emergent marsh quality 45 and utilizing GPS-accelerometers to study fine-scale habitat selection by mallards 45, potentially generating large datasets suitable for advanced analysis. While his core field is wildlife ecology, this recent engagement with DL for vegetation classification demonstrates the adoption of AI tools to address complex ecological questions relevant to natural resource management.

  Dr. Deaton's expertise is in agricultural economics, agribusiness, and finance, with a specific research interest stated as "using machine learning algorithms to better understand the commodity and financial markets" and improve risk management.41 His background includes finance, programming, and agricultural economics.41 While his teaching focuses on agribusiness and agricultural economics 41, and available publication information centers on general market analysis and risk 73, his explicitly stated focus on applying ML algorithms to market dynamics and risk represents a significant computational capability within CFANR. Although direct application to forestry markets or supply chains is not evident in the reviewed materials, the ML methods he employs are highly transferable. This expertise offers considerable potential for collaboration with faculty focused on forest economics and operations (e.g., Pelkki, Boston, Tian, Chhetri, Tanger) to apply ML for timber market forecasting, supply chain risk analysis, or financial decision support in forestry. His integration level is assessed as Moderate/Adjacent based on the stated ML focus and its potential applicability.  
* Matthew H. Pelkki (Professor): Moderate/Adjacent Integration  
  Dr. Pelkki holds the George H. Clippert Endowed Chair and directs the Arkansas Center for Forest Business.21 His research interests explicitly include "numerical methods for forest stand optimization," alongside forest management, economics, valuation of ecosystem services, and forest products/markets.9 His publications demonstrate the application of operations research techniques, including dynamic programming (DP) and heuristics like A\*, for optimizing forest management decisions such as thinning schedules and rotation ages.10 He also works on economic contribution analysis and timber supply modeling.54 While not explicitly employing ML or DL in the reviewed materials, Dr. Pelkki's work utilizes sophisticated mathematical modeling and optimization techniques that are foundational to or overlap with AI fields like planning and decision support. His focus on optimization represents a strong computational approach to core forest management problems.  
* Kevin Boston (Associate Professor): Moderate/Adjacent Integration  
  Dr. Boston's expertise lies in forest harvesting, logging engineering, and operations research.11 His research involves developing and applying advanced optimization heuristics, including Tabu Search, Simulated Annealing, and Genetic Algorithms, to solve complex spatial harvest scheduling problems.12 He also works on modeling and reviewing forest biomass supply chains.12 Furthermore, his research incorporates the use of airborne LiDAR data for predicting understory vegetation cover and detecting individual snags 12, demonstrating familiarity with modern remote sensing data often used in AI applications. Similar to Dr. Pelkki, Dr. Boston's focus is on optimization and operations research rather than explicit ML/DL, but these methods represent a significant computational capability applied to forestry operations and planning. His use of LiDAR data further connects his work to contemporary data-intensive approaches.  
* Pradip Saud (Assistant Professor): Low/Emerging Integration  
  Dr. Saud specializes in forest biometrics, growth and yield modeling, and applied statistics.13 His research involves modeling various forest dynamics, including ice-storm damage, regeneration, fuel loads, vegetation composition, stand structure, and growth, often using long-term experimental data.13 His publications focus on developing taper functions, biomass equations, and growth models using statistical approaches.61 He teaches Biometrics and Applied Predictive Statistics.13 While his work is highly quantitative and foundational for AI applications in forestry, the reviewed materials do not show primary application of ML/DL methods. However, a special issue he co-edited on "Modeling Aboveground Forest Biomass" explicitly welcomed contributions using machine learning 63, indicating awareness and potential interest in these techniques. His expertise in biometrics and predictive statistics provides a strong platform for future integration or collaboration involving ML.  
* Nana Tian (Associate Professor): Low/Emerging Integration  
  Dr. Tian's research centers on human dimensions and economic issues in natural resource management, focusing on how individuals make management and conservation decisions.14 A key area of interest is "Econometric models of private/family landowners' behavior".14 She utilizes qualitative and quantitative tools, including statistics and econometrics, to address policy and management questions.14 Her projects involve landowner surveys, economic assessments of restoration projects, valuation of ecosystem services, and analysis of landowner participation in certification programs.14 While not explicitly labeled as AI/ML, advanced econometric modeling, particularly for predicting behavior based on diverse inputs, shares methodological ground with predictive analytics techniques in machine learning. Her work provides critical socio-economic inputs for integrated modeling efforts.  
* Sagar Godar Chhetri (Assistant Professor): Low/Emerging Integration  
  Dr. Chhetri's research integrates "FIA and survey data along with geospatial information into the econometric models" to address socio-economic and ecological problems in forest resource management.15 His interests include timber demand and supply analysis, econometric and geospatial modeling, private landowner behavior, non-market valuation, and property taxation.15 His publications involve analyses of forest management costs, landowner use of consulting foresters, timber supply, and economic contributions of the forest sector.69 Like Dr. Tian, Dr. Chhetri employs sophisticated quantitative methods, particularly econometric and geospatial modeling, which are adjacent to data science and ML. This provides a foundation for potentially incorporating more advanced predictive or spatial ML techniques.

The distribution of computational approaches among the faculty reveals distinct clusters of expertise. A notable concentration of modern AI/ML techniques, particularly deep learning and cloud-based geospatial analysis (GEE), exists within the geospatial science domain, primarily through Dr. Zurqani's work.5 This is complemented by specific, recent applications of ML in soil science (Dr. Ficklin 16) and wildlife habitat classification (Dr. Osborne 78), and potential applications in market analysis (Dr. Deaton 41). Separately, there is a well-established strength in classical optimization and operations research methods applied to forest management and harvesting, represented by Dr. Pelkki and Dr. Boston.9 A third area involves advanced statistical and econometric modeling applied to biometrics and socio-economic aspects of forestry, evident in the work of Dr. Saud, Dr. Tian, and Dr. Chhetri.13 The available evidence does not strongly indicate significant cross-application between these groups; for instance, ML techniques enhancing the optimization models or geospatial AI outputs directly informing econometric analyses are not explicitly highlighted in the reviewed materials. This suggests that while diverse and sophisticated computational capabilities exist within the program, the integration of cutting-edge AI/ML seems currently driven by specific domain needs (like geospatial analysis or soil prediction) rather than being a universally adopted methodological toolkit across all forestry disciplines within CFANR.

## **6\. Synthesis: AI Research Landscape in UAM Forestry**

**Overall Integration Level:** The integration of AI and related advanced computational methods within the research portfolio of faculty associated with UAM's SAF-accredited Forestry Option can be characterized as **Emerging but Concentrated**. Several faculty members utilize sophisticated computational techniques, but the application of state-of-the-art AI methods like machine learning and deep learning is currently most pronounced and explicitly stated within specific research domains, particularly geospatial science. Strong adjacent capabilities in traditional optimization/operations research and advanced statistical/econometric modeling provide a robust quantitative foundation for the program.

**Identified Strengths:**

* **Geospatial AI and Remote Sensing:** The program possesses a significant and contemporary strength in applying ML and DL techniques to geospatial problems in forestry and natural resources. Dr. Zurqani's research utilizing GEE, multi-source remote sensing data (LiDAR, satellite), and various ML algorithms (RF, GTB, SVM, CART, DL) for applications like AGB estimation, canopy cover mapping, drought monitoring, and vegetation classification represents a leading edge within the program.5 This capability is crucial for addressing modern challenges in large-scale forest monitoring, carbon accounting, and environmental assessment.  
* **Optimization and Operations Research:** There is established expertise in applying classical optimization techniques (e.g., dynamic programming) and advanced heuristics (e.g., Tabu Search, Simulated Annealing, Genetic Algorithms) to complex forest management and operational problems, such as harvest scheduling and supply chain logistics. This is primarily represented by the work of Dr. Pelkki and Dr. Boston.9 These methods are fundamental for developing decision support tools for sustainable forest management.  
* **Advanced Statistical and Econometric Modeling:** Faculty demonstrate strong capabilities in utilizing advanced statistical methods for forest biometrics (growth and yield modeling, sampling) and sophisticated econometric modeling to analyze landowner behavior, ecosystem service valuation, and market dynamics.13 This quantitative rigor underpins much of the resource assessment and socio-economic research within the program.  
* **Domain-Specific ML Adoption:** Evidence indicates the adoption of ML techniques as powerful analytical tools within specific domains beyond geospatial science, such as predicting soil properties (Dr. Ficklin 16) and potentially in analyzing commodity markets (Dr. Deaton 41).

**Potential Gaps and Opportunities:**

* **Broader AI/ML Diffusion:** While present, the application of advanced ML/DL techniques appears less diffused across all relevant forestry disciplines compared to the concentration in geospatial science. Opportunities exist to explore ML/DL applications further in areas like forest biometrics (beyond standard statistical models), ecological forecasting, and forest products analysis.  
* **AI in Forest Health:** Forest health is a critical area, particularly with changing climate conditions. While Dr. Sims possesses expertise in pathology and entomology 35, the current evidence does not highlight the use of AI tools (e.g., computer vision for early disease/pest detection from imagery, ML for predicting outbreak risk) within this specific research area at UAM. Integrating AI could significantly enhance monitoring and predictive capabilities for forest health threats in Arkansas.  
* **AI in Forest Operations/Robotics:** Beyond the existing strengths in optimization for planning (Pelkki, Boston), there is an opportunity to explore AI applications closer to real-time operations, such as sensor data analysis for equipment monitoring, autonomous systems, or AI-driven decision support during harvesting.  
* **Interdisciplinary Computational Synergy:** A significant opportunity lies in fostering greater collaboration between faculty groups with different computational strengths. Integrating the high-resolution spatial predictions from Dr. Zurqani's AI models with the optimization frameworks of Dr. Pelkki and Dr. Boston could lead to powerful, spatially explicit decision support systems. Similarly, incorporating ML-derived environmental or market predictions into the econometric models used by Dr. Tian and Dr. Chhetri could enhance their analyses of landowner behavior and policy impacts.

**Key AI Research Contributors:** The assessment identifies the following faculty as key contributors to AI and advanced computational research relevant to the forestry program:

* **High Integration:** Hamdi A. Zurqani (Geospatial AI/ML/DL)  
* **Moderate/Adjacent Integration:** Robert L. Ficklin (ML in Soils), Douglas C. Osborne (DL in Habitat Classification), Brian Deaton (ML in Market Analysis \- Potential), Matthew H. Pelkki (Optimization/OR), Kevin Boston (Optimization/OR, LiDAR)  
* **Low/Emerging Integration:** Pradip Saud (Advanced Stats/Biometrics), Nana Tian (Econometrics), Sagar Godar Chhetri (Econometrics/Geospatial Modeling)

The program's current computational landscape shows a strong foundation built on both traditional quantitative strengths (optimization, statistics, econometrics) and a significant, modern thrust in geospatial AI. This combination positions UAM well to tackle key issues in forest management, monitoring, and economics relevant to Arkansas and the wider region. The apparent concentration of advanced AI/ML within specific domains, however, suggests that strategic initiatives to encourage cross-disciplinary computational research could yield substantial benefits. For example, the detailed spatial insights generated by Dr. Zurqani's GEE and ML approaches could provide novel inputs to refine the stand-level optimization models developed by Dr. Pelkki or the harvest scheduling heuristics used by Dr. Boston, leading to more precise and adaptive management planning tools. Furthermore, addressing the apparent gap in explicit AI application within forest health research could be crucial for developing proactive strategies against emerging threats exacerbated by climate change.

## **7\. Concluding Remarks**

The University of Arkansas at Monticello's B.S. in Natural Resources Management (Forestry Option) program, the sole SAF-accredited forestry program in Arkansas, demonstrates an **Emerging but Concentrated** level of AI integration within its associated faculty's research. The program benefits from distinct pockets of strength in advanced computation. Notably, there is high integration of contemporary AI/ML and cloud computing platforms (GEE) within geospatial science, led by Dr. Hamdi Zurqani. This is complemented by established expertise in optimization and operations research applied to forest management and harvesting (Dr. Matthew Pelkki, Dr. Kevin Boston) and robust capabilities in advanced statistical and econometric modeling across biometrics and socio-economic research (Dr. Robert Ficklin, Dr. Pradip Saud, Dr. Nana Tian, Dr. Sagar Chhetri). Recent adoption of ML techniques is also evident in soil science and potentially in market analysis.

Key opportunities for future development include fostering greater diffusion of AI/ML techniques across other forestry disciplines, particularly in forest health, where AI tools could enhance monitoring and prediction capabilities. Enhancing collaboration between faculty with expertise in geospatial AI, optimization/OR, and econometrics could unlock significant synergies, leading to more sophisticated and integrated modeling and decision-support systems.

Given UAM's unique role in Arkansas forestry education and its direct link to research and extension through the Arkansas Forest Resources Center 21, strengthening its AI capabilities holds significant potential. Continued strategic investment in faculty expertise, computational resources, and interdisciplinary research focused on AI applications can solidify the program's leadership position. By further embracing AI and advanced computational methods, UAM's CFANR can enhance its contributions to sustainable forest management, economic development, and environmental stewardship within Arkansas and beyond.
