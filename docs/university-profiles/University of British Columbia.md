# **The Integration of Artificial Intelligence in Forestry and Environmental Science Programs at the University of British Columbia**

## **I. Executive Summary**

The University of British Columbia (UBC) stands as a significant global center for forestry and environmental science education and research. The Faculty of Forestry, ranked \#1 in Canada, possesses substantial resources, including dedicated research forests and specialized centers like the Centre for Advanced Wood Processing and the Centre for Wildfire Coexistence. While foundational quantitative skills, particularly in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and remote sensing, are well-integrated into forestry and related environmental science curricula, the explicit incorporation of advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) methodologies into core program requirements appears limited. Specialized programs like the Master of Geomatics for Environmental Management (MGEM) offer focused training in advanced geospatial technologies and programming. Expertise in cutting-edge AI/ML research primarily resides within UBC's Computer Science and Statistics departments, alongside the interdisciplinary Data Science Institute (DSI). Leveraging these capabilities for forestry applications necessitates strong interdisciplinary collaboration, supported by UBC's robust central infrastructure like Advanced Research Computing (ARC) and DSI. While UBC's institutional strategy increasingly emphasizes AI, the Faculty of Forestry's strategic plans focus more broadly on innovation and addressing environmental challenges, positioning AI as an implicit enabler rather than an explicit core priority. A comprehensive framework for Responsible Conduct of Research exists, though domain-specific AI ethics training tailored to forestry contexts may represent an area for future development. Overall, UBC possesses the foundational strengths, institutional resources, and burgeoning expertise to significantly advance AI integration in forestry, but realizing this potential requires bridging disciplinary gaps, potentially enhancing core curricula, and ensuring effective utilization of centralized computational resources.

## **II. UBC Faculty of Forestry Overview**

The Faculty of Forestry at the University of British Columbia is a globally recognized leader in forest-related education and research, consistently ranked as the top institution for forestry in Canada and among the best worldwide.1 It distinguishes itself through a unique breadth of expertise, enabling the integration of knowledge across numerous disciplines to address pressing global environmental and forest science challenges, including biodiversity management, the bioeconomy, conservation, and sustainability.1 In the 2023/2024 academic year, the Faculty secured $14.4 million in research awards, supporting the work of its 84 full-time faculty members.2 This represents the highest level of forestry research funding of any faculty in Canada.2 The Faculty fosters an environment of active learning, characterized by small, engaging classes and a low instructor-to-student ratio of 1:17.1 It served approximately 1020 undergraduate and 371 graduate students (214 Master's, 157 Doctoral) in 2023\.2

**A. Faculty Structure**

The Faculty is organized into three core departments, each specializing in distinct areas of forestry 2:

1. **Department of Forest and Conservation Sciences:** Focuses on the biological and ecological aspects of forests and their conservation.  
2. **Department of Forest Resources Management:** Concentrates on the planning, stewardship, and operational aspects of managing forest resources for various goods and services.  
3. **Department of Wood Science:** Specializes in the science, processing, and advanced manufacturing of wood products.

This structure facilitates specialized research and education while allowing for interdisciplinary collaboration across the Faculty.

**B. Research Infrastructure**

UBC Forestry provides state-of-the-art facilities for teaching and research. The Forest Sciences Centre on the Vancouver campus features high-tech classrooms, advanced laboratories, and wireless study spaces within a nature-inspired architectural design.4 Crucially, the Faculty manages extensive off-campus research forests, including the Malcolm Knapp Research Forest near Maple Ridge and the Alex Fraser Research Forest near Williams Lake.2 These two forests alone encompass over 25,000 hectares (more than 60,000 acres) and function as "working forests" and vital "outdoor settings".2 They provide invaluable opportunities for students and faculty to conduct field studies and research in diverse ecosystems, covering areas like silviculture, forest ecology, harvesting, wildlife management, and resource management.2 A project is underway to renew the Malcolm Knapp Research Forest as a hub for forestry, conservation, and climate change research and education.3

**C. Key Research Centers/Groups (within Forestry)**

Within the Faculty, several specialized centers and research groups drive innovation and applied research 3:

* **Centre for Advanced Wood Processing (CAWP):** Canada's national center for applied research, education, and training related to wood products processing and manufacturing.2  
* **Centre for Applied Conservation Research:** Focuses on research relevant to conservation challenges.6  
* **Sustainable Forest Management Research Group/Laboratory:** Encourages interdisciplinary research into sustainable forest management practices.6  
* **Centre for Wildfire Coexistence (CWC):** Established in Fall 2023, this center advances research, collaboration, and innovation in forest management, eco-cultural restoration, and wildfire management strategies, employing a data-led, proactive approach.3  
* Other groups include the Forest Measurements and Biometrics group, Watershed Hydrology Laboratory, and Timber Building Technology Group.6

These centers provide focused environments for research that could increasingly incorporate AI and computational methods.

**D. Accreditation Context**

Several key programs within the Faculty of Forestry are designed to meet the academic requirements for professional registration, particularly as a Registered Professional Forester (RPF) in British Columbia and potentially elsewhere. Programs such as the BSc in Natural Resources majors in Forest Management and Forest Operations, the Master of Sustainable Forest Management (MSFM), and the Bachelor of Urban Forestry (BUF) hold or are actively seeking accreditation from the Canadian Forestry Accreditation Board (CFAB).10 Candidacy for accreditation by the Society of American Foresters (SAF) is also being pursued for the Forest Management and Forest Operations majors.11

The emphasis on meeting the standards set by these accreditation bodies, which define the core competencies necessary for professional practice 7, likely influences curriculum design. These standards traditionally focus on established forestry principles and practices. While not precluding the adoption of new technologies, the need to satisfy these rigorous, often stable, accreditation requirements might moderate the pace at which rapidly evolving and non-traditional fields like AI and ML are integrated into the *required* core curriculum of these specific professional programs. This suggests a potential dynamic where established professional competencies are prioritized in the mandatory coursework, potentially positioning advanced computational techniques more within elective streams or specialized graduate programs, rather than as a universal requirement for all graduates seeking professional designation immediately upon completion.

## **III. Curriculum Integration Analysis**

An examination of UBC Forestry and related programs reveals a strong emphasis on quantitative methods, particularly geospatial technologies, but limited explicit integration of AI/ML into core curricula outside of specialized programs.

**A. Quantitative Methods in Forestry Programs (Undergraduate & Graduate)**

Forestry education at UBC inherently incorporates quantitative reasoning and skills across its programs.

* **Foundational Skills:** The Bachelor of Science (BSc) in Natural Resources program, encompassing majors like Conservation, Forest Management, Forest Operations, and Forest Sciences, integrates disciplines such as biology, ecology, physics, and economics.7 Curricula consistently include foundational coursework in quantitative methods, statistics, modeling, GIS, and remote sensing.9 Specific course examples underpinning this foundation include FRST 231 (Introduction to Biometrics), which serves as a prerequisite for intermediate statistics courses like STAT 300 22, and courses listed within program maps such as "Introduction to Biometrics and Computer Applications," "Geographic Information Systems," and "Remote Sensing" within the Conservation major.23 Foundational statistics (like STAT 200 or BIOL 300, required or recommended in the related Environmental Sciences program 24) are also essential components.  
* **Geospatial Strength:** GIS and remote sensing are particularly prominent skill areas. They are integral to the Conservation major 9, where students learn to apply these tools for planning and management, sometimes using software like QGIS.25 These tools are also crucial in Forest Management and Forest Operations for mapping, monitoring, and operational planning.19 This emphasis is mirrored in the related Environmental Sciences program 20 and is the central focus of the Master of Geomatics for Environmental Management (MGEM) program.27 Faculty research further underscores this strength, with numerous publications and projects utilizing geospatial data.2  
* **Modeling & Biometrics:** Forest biometrics, statistical sampling, growth and yield modeling, and quantitative analysis form the bedrock of several programs, especially Forest Sciences, Forest Management, and Forest Operations.6 Faculty expertise in this area is deep, covering forest inventory methods, statistical modeling of forest dynamics, and sampling theory.31 Coursework includes forest measurements, sampling design, model fitting, growth and yield analysis, and advanced modeling techniques using linear, nonlinear, and mixed-effects models.33  
* **Limited Explicit AI/ML in Core Forestry:** Despite the presence of computer applications, programming (with R and Python explicitly mentioned in the MGEM program 27 and a directed studies course FRST 533 33), and advanced statistical modeling courses 33, explicit references to AI or ML *within the standard course descriptions of core undergraduate Forestry programs or traditional research-based graduate programs* (MSc, PhD in Forestry) are notably scarce in the available documentation.19 The integration of these advanced computational techniques appears primarily concentrated in specialized programs or individual research initiatives rather than being a universal component of the core Forestry curriculum.

**B. Analysis of Key Related Programs**

Several programs at UBC, both within and outside the Faculty of Forestry, offer curricula highly relevant to data-intensive environmental analysis:

* **Master of Geomatics for Environmental Management (MGEM):** Housed within the Faculty of Forestry, this intensive 9-month professional Master's program 40 serves as a significant hub for advanced geospatial training. Its curriculum explicitly integrates landscape ecology principles with the practical application of geospatial tools and technologies.27 Core coursework covers GIS (GEM 510, GEM 511), remote sensing including LiDAR and image processing (GEM 520, GEM 521), spatial statistics and linear regression models (GEM 540), and geospatial data analysis, including programming with R and Python (GEM 530).27 The program equips graduates with skills in landscape quantification modeling, spatial data analysis, and project management, preparing them to tackle real-world environmental issues using geomatics.27  
* **Environmental Sciences (BSc Major/Honours \- Faculty of Science, EOAS):** Offered by the Department of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences (EOAS), this interdisciplinary program provides students with a robust foundation in physical, earth, ocean, atmospheric, and life sciences, along with chemistry.20 It mandates foundational mathematics and statistics (e.g., STAT 200/201, BIOL 300).24 A key feature is the 'Tools' elective requirement, allowing students to select courses in areas like GIS and remote sensing (e.g., GEOS/GEOB 270, 370, 373\) or potentially computational modeling (e.g., EOSC 211, FRST 443).24 Further specialization is possible through Areas of Concentration such as 'Land, Air, and Water,' which includes courses in hydrology, oceanography, and atmospheric modeling, or 'Sustainability Science'.24 Graduates develop skills in field methods, data analysis, modeling, GIS, statistics, and computer programming, often working on team projects with community partners.20  
* **Resources, Environment and Sustainability (MSc/MA/PhD \- IRES, Faculty of Science):** The Institute for Resources, Environment and Sustainability (IRES) offers interdisciplinary graduate programs focused on integrating the biophysical, socio-economic, and political dimensions of resource management within the context of sustainability.45 Faculty research within IRES heavily involves quantitative and computational approaches, including climate modeling, environmental systems modeling, ecological modeling, causal inference, applied deep learning, and data analysis to address sustainability challenges.45 This program represents a significant pathway for students seeking advanced research training in computational sustainability science.

**C. Accessibility of Advanced AI/ML/Data Science Courses**

UBC offers a rich ecosystem of advanced courses in AI, ML, and data science, primarily through the Departments of Computer Science and Statistics, and the Data Science Institute.

* **Computer Science Offerings:** The Department of Computer Science provides a wide array of undergraduate and graduate courses covering the spectrum of AI and ML. Foundational courses include CPSC 322 (Introduction to Artificial Intelligence) and CPSC 340 (Machine Learning and Data Mining).55 Applied ML is covered in CPSC 330\.55 More advanced topics are explored in courses like CPSC 422 (Intelligent Systems), CPSC 425 (Computer Vision), CPSC 440 (Advanced Machine Learning \- focusing on probabilistic models, deep learning), CPSC 540 (Machine Learning), and specialized topics courses (CPSC 532, CPSC 539\) covering areas like multi-agent systems and probabilistic programming.55 Deep learning, including generative models (VAEs, diffusion models) and reinforcement learning, is covered in courses like CPEN 455\.58 Manufacturing applications are addressed in MANU 465\.55  
* **Statistics Offerings:** The Department of Statistics offers courses directly relevant to data science and ML. STAT 201 provides an introduction to Statistical Inference for Data Science.59 STAT 301 focuses on Statistical Modelling for Data Science, utilizing tools like R and Jupyter notebooks to cover regression, GLMs, A/B testing concepts, and model evaluation.59 STAT 306 teaches methods for Finding Relationships in Data, including multiple regression, logistic regression, PCA, and cluster analysis.59 STAT 406 covers Methods for Statistical Learning.61 The popular STAT 545 course focuses intensely on practical data analysis, manipulation, and visualization using R and the tidyverse.62 Graduate courses delve into Bayesian inference, multivariate methods, spatial statistics, and other advanced topics.62 Additionally, related courses exist in other departments, such as ECON 323 (Quantitative Economic Modeling and Data Science).65  
* **Data Science Programs/Courses:** UBC has significantly invested in data science education, offering a professional Master of Data Science (MDS) program 66, new BSc Major programs in Data Science at both Vancouver and Okanagan campuses 67, and a Minor in Data Science.67 The Data Science Minor, designed to be interdisciplinary, requires foundational courses (DSCI 100, STAT 201, CPSC 203/210, Calculus) and upper-level courses including STAT 301, CPSC 330, an ethics course (DSCI/CPSC 430), and three electives chosen from areas like data visualization (DSCI 320), cloud computing (CPSC 416), databases (CPSC 304), or discipline-specific data science applications (e.g., CPSC 340, STAT 406, EOSC 410).67 UBC Extended Learning further complements these offerings with certificates and individual courses in Data Science, Python programming, ML, and data visualization.69  
* **Prerequisites & Accessibility:** While specific prerequisites for every advanced course were not available in the reviewed materials 36, accessing upper-level Computer Science and Statistics courses typically demands a solid foundation in core computer science concepts (systematic programming, data structures, algorithms \- e.g., CPSC 110, 210, 221 72) and mathematics/statistics (calculus, linear algebra, probability theory \- e.g., MATH 100/101, 200, 221, STAT 302 24). Standard Forestry curricula provide foundational science and mathematics 23, but students may lack the specific computer science prerequisites needed for direct entry into many advanced AI/ML courses. Pursuing these advanced computational skills would likely require Forestry students to strategically use elective slots or formally enroll in programs like the Data Science Minor, which itself has specific CPSC, STAT, and MATH prerequisites.67

The availability of robust programs and courses in CS, Stats, and Data Science, including the interdisciplinary Data Science Minor 55, clearly provides *pathways* for motivated Forestry students to acquire sophisticated AI/ML skills. However, the current structure, where these advanced topics are largely housed outside the core Forestry curriculum 19, indicates that developing deep AI/ML expertise presently relies more on individual student initiative and navigating inter-faculty requirements, rather than being an integrated, foundational component for all Forestry graduates. Specialized programs like MGEM represent an exception, embedding advanced computational and programming skills directly within a Forestry-housed degree.27

**C. Distributed Expertise and the Collaboration Imperative**

The landscape of expertise at UBC reveals a clear pattern: while the Faculty of Forestry possesses strong domain knowledge and well-developed capabilities in applied quantitative methods, geospatial analysis, and traditional environmental modeling 29, the development of cutting-edge AI/ML algorithms and advanced theoretical work is primarily concentrated within the Departments of Computer Science and Statistics.55 Concurrently, departments like EOAS and institutes like IRES offer deep expertise in sophisticated environmental and sustainability modeling, often incorporating advanced computational techniques.46

This distribution underscores the critical importance of interdisciplinary collaboration for the Faculty of Forestry to fully harness the potential of AI and advanced computation. Effectively bridging the gap between forestry domain problems and state-of-the-art computational methods requires formalized partnerships and knowledge exchange. Fortunately, UBC's strategic direction encourages such collaboration 98, and institutional structures like the Data Science Institute 67 and the Centre for Artificial Intelligence Decision-making and Action (CAIDA) 83 are specifically designed to facilitate these cross-disciplinary interactions. Existing funded collaborations, such as NSERC Alliance grants involving Forestry faculty working with partners and leveraging remote sensing 73, provide successful precedents for this model.

* **HPC Resources:** Researchers gain access to significant computational power through ARC-managed HPC clusters, such as Sockeye and Chinook.102 Access to the Sockeye cluster is facilitated through user-friendly interfaces like the UBC ARC OnDemand portal.102 ARC provides substantial storage solutions structured into different tiers (Home, Project, Scratch), each with defined quotas and characteristics; for example, individual home directories typically have a 50 GB limit, while shared project and scratch spaces offer terabytes of storage but may have file count limits (e.g., 1 million files on scratch) that need careful management within research groups.107 GPU resources, essential for many AI/ML workloads, are also available, evidenced by mentions of the nibi-gpu system and NSERC/CFI funding for NVIDIA A100 GPUs for specific research projects.109  
* **Software & Tools:** ARC provides institutional support for key research software platforms. This includes REDCap, a secure web application widely used for building and managing research data collection instruments, particularly suitable for sensitive data.104 Globus is supported for secure and efficient transfer of large datasets between local machines, ARC systems, and other research endpoints globally.104 While a specific list of all available AI/ML frameworks (like TensorFlow, PyTorch) wasn't detailed in the snippets, ARC's support for the national DRI ecosystem 106 and events focused on tools like JAX for Bayesian modeling 102 imply access to a standard suite of scientific computing and data analysis software.  
* **Support & Training:** ARC offers user support through documentation, direct contact (arc.support@ubc.ca), consultations, and training events or workshops.102 They also assist researchers in preparing grant proposals that require DRI components.106

**B. UBC Data Science Institute (DSI)**

The DSI operates as a vital interdisciplinary hub within the Faculty of Science, specifically designed to connect researchers from Computer Science, Statistics, Mathematics, and other disciplines across the university engaging in data-intensive work.67

* **Role:** DSI's mandate is to incubate and accelerate research, innovation, and training in data science.67 It works closely with ARC and the broader data science community at UBC.67  
* **Activities:** DSI actively fosters collaboration through various mechanisms, including co-funding opportunities for faculty to hire data science postdoctoral fellows, organizing speaker series and workshops (such as a Machine Learning workshop for trainees 96), and running programs like the Data Science Catalyst Program (supporting pilot projects) and the Data Science for Social Good (DSSG) Summer Fellowships.67 It also engages with external partners (industry, non-profits) on data-driven challenges.67 Examples of DSI-involved research include using NLP to aid NASA's landslide detection efforts by analyzing news articles and Reddit posts 67 and improving cancer registry processes.96  
* **Relevance to Forestry:** For the Faculty of Forestry, DSI represents a crucial institutional asset. It provides a clear point of contact and a platform for accessing specialized data science expertise, identifying potential collaborators, participating in training opportunities, and potentially securing support for data-intensive research projects. The existence and activities of DSI signal strong institutional commitment to advancing data science across campus.

**C. Access Policies and Support**

* **Software Access:** Access to the common software stack provided through the national DRI network is generally available to users of ARC systems.106 Access to specific licensed commercial software may depend on institutional site licenses or licenses procured by individual research groups or departments.  
* **Support:** Direct technical support for ARC systems is available through their support channels.107 DSI offers consultation and partnership facilitation.67 Additionally, faculty-level IT units, like the one mentioned for Geography 105, may provide support for ensuring local computers meet security standards for accessing research data.

The presence of powerful, centralized resources like ARC and DSI 67 indicates that UBC possesses the necessary infrastructural backbone for computationally intensive research, including AI in forestry. The primary challenge for a domain-focused faculty like Forestry is likely less about the *availability* of these resources and more about ensuring their effective *access, utilization, and integration*. Bridging the gap between specific forestry research questions and the capabilities of central HPC and data science platforms may require dedicated support mechanisms or personnel within the Faculty of Forestry—individuals who possess both domain understanding and familiarity with the advanced computational tools and expertise available centrally. This could involve targeted training programs, dedicated liaison roles, or embedding computational experts within forestry research groups.

## **VI. Strategic Alignment and Initiatives**

UBC's institutional strategy and specific initiatives within the Faculty of Forestry provide context for the integration of AI and computational methods.

**A. UBC Institutional Priorities**

UBC's overarching strategic direction clearly signals an increasing focus on AI and digital transformation.

* **Shaping UBC's Next Century (2018-2028) & Refresh:** The university's 10-year strategic plan emphasizes core themes of research excellence, interdisciplinary collaboration, innovation, inclusion, knowledge exchange, and addressing major societal challenges.98 The ongoing refresh process, looking towards 2025 and beyond, explicitly recognizes "Artificial intelligence, emerging technologies & digital futures" as a significant trend and pressure shaping the post-secondary landscape.111 Internal consultations have identified "Lead in AI" as a potential priority area, with suggested actions including providing the necessary infrastructure to support AI innovation in both teaching and research.112 The plan reinforces support for strengthening shared research infrastructure, such as ARC and DSI, and enabling interdisciplinary research clusters.98  
* **AI Focus:** UBC actively promotes its leadership in AI, highlighting research strengths in developing core AI algorithms and applying AI across diverse domains including human health, environmental monitoring, language processing, materials discovery, and computer vision/graphics.83 Key research hubs like the Centre for Artificial Intelligence Decision-making and Action (CAIDA) and the Data Science Institute (DSI) are central to this strategy.83 The university acknowledges the importance of addressing the ethical dimensions and privacy concerns associated with AI's growing societal role.82

**B. Faculty of Forestry Strategic Plan Alignment**

The Faculty of Forestry's strategic plans outline ambitious goals focused on research, learning, and engagement, providing a framework where AI and computation can serve as powerful enabling tools.

* **2019-2029 Plan:** This earlier plan centered on four core areas: People and Places, Excellence in Research, Transformative Learning, and Local and Global Engagement.100 Key initiatives included fostering an inclusive and healthy environment, enhancing research collaboration through "Clusters of Excellence," innovating in teaching and learning, improving knowledge management, and maximizing agility through systems renewal.100 While AI was not an explicit focus, the emphasis on innovation, collaboration, addressing complex problems, and enhancing the learning environment created fertile ground for integrating advanced computational approaches.  
* **2025-2030 Plan:** Developed through extensive consultation 114, the new five-year plan acknowledges the evolving context, including shifting public perceptions of forestry, interconnected global challenges like climate change and wildfires, and changing student interests towards sustainability, conservation, innovation, and policy impact.115 The plan aims to tackle these challenges through diverse and transformational approaches, with a strong emphasis on Indigenous land stewardship, innovative products and management strategies, conservation, and interdisciplinary collaborations.99  
  * *Research Objectives:* Key goals include being a trusted leader in solutions-oriented scholarship and knowledge translation, championing interdisciplinary collaboration (supported by funding, retreats, and graduate student events), advancing impactful partnerships, and positioning the research forests as global hubs for forestry, conservation, and climate change research.99  
  * *Learning Objectives:* The plan aims for leadership in transformative education that embraces Indigeneity, diversity, and innovative pedagogy. Actions include enhancing skills progression, integrating global topics, increasing access to Indigenous worldviews, expanding experiential and field-based learning (including the Haida Gwaii Institute), exploring flexible online and professional program delivery, and ensuring exceptional student support.99

An analysis of these strategic documents reveals a difference in emphasis. While UBC's institutional strategy is becoming increasingly explicit about positioning the university as a leader in AI 83, the Faculty of Forestry's strategic plans (both past and upcoming) prioritize broader themes such as innovation, interdisciplinarity, sustainability, transformative learning, and addressing complex environmental challenges.99 Within the Forestry plans reviewed, AI and data science appear positioned as powerful *tools* or *enablers* that can contribute significantly to achieving these overarching goals—for instance, through advanced modeling for climate adaptation research, data analytics for conservation planning, or computational methods for developing innovative bio-products. However, AI/Data Science themselves are not explicitly articulated as standalone strategic *priorities* or core pillars in the same manner as seen in the university-wide discourse. The Faculty's strategic focus seems directed more towards the desired *outcomes* (e.g., sustainable solutions, impactful learning, research leadership) rather than specifying AI as a primary strategic *means* in its documented plans.

**C. Key Research Centers, Institutes, and Funded Projects**

UBC hosts numerous centers and initiatives, and secures significant funding, relevant to AI and computation in environmental contexts.

* **Internal Forestry Centers:** As previously mentioned, centers like CAWP, CWC, Applied Conservation Research, and the SFM Research Group provide established structures for focused research within Forestry.3 The CWC's explicit mention of a "data-led" approach for wildfire management highlights the integration of data analytics.3  
* **Cross-Faculty/Institutional Centers:** DSI 67, CAIDA 83, and the Institute for Computing, Information and Cognitive Systems (ICICS) 84 serve as major interdisciplinary hubs fostering collaboration in data science, AI, and advanced computing systems. The BioProducts Institute, involving Forestry, also represents a collaborative entity where computation could play a role.79  
* **Funded Projects (Examples):** Funding patterns offer concrete evidence of research activity and priorities. UBC researchers receive substantial funding through NSERC's Discovery Research Program across various fields.116 NSERC Alliance grants demonstrate successful partnerships leveraging UBC expertise; notable examples include Prof. Nicholas Coops (jointly appointed in Forestry/Geography) leading projects with partners like FYBR Inc. and the BC Ministry of Forests, using advanced remote sensing to assess spruce provenance trials, estimate forest structure for Predictive Ecosystem Mapping (PEM), and evaluate Marbled Murrelet habitat.73 Other Alliance grants fund collaborations in engineering, computer science, and ocean sciences, often involving industry or government partners.73 Recent Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI) Innovation Fund proposals highlight future directions, describing potential core facilities focused on environmental simulation using digital twins, HPC, and AI; sustainable agriculture modeling; energy system digital twins integrating AI and predictive analytics; and air mobility research integrating computer vision, AI, and autonomous drones with advanced sensors like LiDAR.110 Individual faculty labs secure funding, such as NSERC Discovery Grants supporting specific research programs (e.g., Cembrowski Lab in neuroscience 117). Collaborative training programs like PRODIGY (Pacific Rim Ocean Data Mobilization and Technology) bring together researchers from oceanography, geophysics, computer science, and statistics for projects involving ocean observation, data science, modeling, and assimilation.94 Initiatives like "Forestry 4.0," associated with Adjunct Professor Alan Potter, focus on the Internet of Forests, data analytics, and AI for optimizing forest operations.80 Industry collaborations, such as the one between TerraSense Analytics and UBC Okanagan's STAR initiative, apply AI, deep learning, and computer vision to remote sensing challenges in forestry (tree counting) and environmental monitoring (whale tracking).118

The flow of major research funding, particularly through collaborative programs like NSERC Alliance and infrastructure grants like CFI, provides tangible indicators of where UBC's strengths lie and where strategic investments are being made. The successful Alliance grants led by Prof. Coops 73 confirm the Faculty's ability to leverage its remote sensing expertise in partnership contexts. Furthermore, the forward-looking descriptions of proposed CFI projects 110, explicitly incorporating AI, digital twins, HPC, and advanced sensor data for environmental applications, signal the direction of future resource-intensive research where computation is central. Tracking these large-scale funding awards offers valuable insight into the concrete application of advanced computation and AI, often within collaborative frameworks, and points towards strategic research frontiers receiving significant institutional and external support.

## **VII. AI Ethics and Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR)**

UBC maintains a comprehensive framework to ensure the responsible and ethical conduct of research across the university, which applies to all researchers, including those in the Faculty of Forestry.

**A. UBC's Framework for RCR and Scholarly Integrity**

The university's approach to research integrity is formalized and supported through various policies and resources.

* **Policy:** UBC Policy SC6 (Scholarly Integrity), formerly Policy 85, establishes the standards and responsibilities required of all UBC researchers and outlines procedures for investigating allegations of scholarly misconduct, such as fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism.119  
* **Values:** The framework is grounded in the core values of honesty, accountability, openness, and fairness in the pursuit and dissemination of knowledge.119  
* **Scope:** RCR at UBC encompasses a broad range of topics beyond just misconduct, including best practices in data management, responsible authorship, peer review, mentorship, managing conflicts of interest, and the ethical treatment of human participants and animals in research.119  
* **Support:** The Scholarly Integrity Initiative serves as a central resource hub.120 The Office of Research Ethics (ORE) provides specific guidance notes and oversees the ethical review of research involving humans.121 Other support units include the Animal Care and Use Program (ACUP) and Indigenous Research Support Services (IRSS).121

**B. Availability and Requirements for Ethics Training**

UBC mandates and provides access to standardized ethics training for its research community.

* **TCPS 2 / CORE:** A key requirement is the completion of the Tri-Council Policy Statement 2: Ethical Conduct for Research Involving Humans (TCPS 2 2022\) online tutorial, known as CORE (Course on Research Ethics).124 This training is mandatory for all members of a research team (faculty, students, staff) involved in human participant research whose applications were submitted after September 1, 2016\.124 CORE covers the fundamental ethical principles and guidelines for conducting research with humans in Canada.  
* **CITI Program:** UBC provides access to the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) Program, an internationally recognized platform for research ethics education.124 CITI offers various courses, including modules on Good Clinical Practice (GCP), Human Subjects Research (HSR \- with Biomedical and Social-Behavioural focuses), and Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR).124 The CITI RCR modules cover core topics aligned with federal funding agency requirements (e.g., NIH, NSF, USDA), such as authorship, data management, conflicts of interest, peer review, collaboration, mentorship, and research misconduct.122 Completion of relevant CITI HSR modules can fulfill the TCPS 2 training requirement.124  
* **Other Resources:** UBC also points researchers towards additional resources, such as the US Office of Research Integrity's interactive training simulation "The Lab," discipline-specific guides (e.g., for social sciences, ethical writing), and resources on data management best practices.121

**C. Specific Considerations or Integration within Forestry**

The general RCR framework and training requirements apply universally across UBC, including the Faculty of Forestry.119 However, the specific ethical considerations arising from the use of AI in forestry and environmental science contexts warrant attention.

* **General Applicability:** Forestry researchers and students must adhere to Policy SC6 and complete mandatory training like TCPS 2/CORE if their research involves human participants. General RCR principles regarding data integrity, authorship, and conflict of interest are fully applicable.  
* **AI Ethics:** The existing RCR framework provides a foundation, but the unique ethical challenges posed specifically by AI—such as algorithmic bias in predictive models (e.g., wildfire risk assessment, resource allocation), data privacy issues arising from large-scale environmental sensor networks or remote sensing data, the transparency and interpretability ('explainability') of complex AI models used for environmental decision-making, and accountability for AI system outcomes—are not explicitly addressed in dedicated Forestry-specific training materials found in the reviewed snippets. While UBC acknowledges ethical concerns surrounding AI broadly 83, and resources like the ethical decision-making framework 125, conflict of interest guidelines 121, the Human-AI Interaction Lab's focus 83, courses like PHIL 331 (Computer Ethics) 68, the ethics requirement in the Data Science Minor 67, and CITI's module on "AI and Human Subject Protections" 123 touch upon these issues, their specific integration into the Forestry context is not evident from the provided materials.

While UBC has established a robust and standard RCR framework, including mandatory training like TCPS 2/CORE 119, which provides a necessary ethical foundation, the specific nuances and potential pitfalls of applying AI in forestry and environmental domains may require more targeted discussion. The current generic training might not fully equip researchers and students to navigate complex issues like potential biases in environmental prediction models derived from historical data, the ethical implications of using AI for surveillance in conservation, or ensuring the transparency of AI-driven tools used in public policy related to natural resources. This suggests an opportunity or potential need within the Faculty of Forestry, or in collaboration with ethics and AI experts at UBC, to develop domain-specific workshops, case studies, or guidelines that address the unique ethical landscape of AI in environmental science and resource management.

## **VIII. Synthesis and Forward Outlook**

* **Strategic Alignment:** Strong institutional strategic push towards AI and data science leadership 83; Forestry's strategic goals align with using innovative tools to address complex environmental problems.99  
* **Research Infrastructure:** Excellent on-campus facilities (Forest Sciences Centre) and extensive off-campus research forests.2  
* **Ethical Framework:** Robust university-wide system for Responsible Conduct of Research and mandatory ethics training.119

**C. Gaps/Opportunities**

* **Core Curriculum Integration:** Limited explicit AI/ML content within core undergraduate (BSc Nat Res majors) and traditional graduate (MSc/PhD Forestry) program requirements.19  
* **Accessibility & Pathways:** Reliance on student initiative to pursue advanced AI/ML skills through electives or minors (like the DS Minor) which have prerequisites potentially outside the standard Forestry track.36  
* **Bridging Expertise:** Need for enhanced mechanisms to connect Forestry domain problems with the advanced AI/ML algorithm expertise residing primarily in CS/Stats \[Insight 3\].  
* **Resource Utilization:** Potential gap in fully leveraging centralized ARC/DSI resources due to need for tailored support and training for Forestry applications \[Insight 4\].  
* **Strategic Explicitness:** Forestry's strategic plan could more explicitly articulate the role and goals for AI/Data Science integration \[Insight 5\].  
* **Domain-Specific AI Ethics:** Lack of specific guidance or training on AI ethics tailored to forestry and environmental contexts \[Insight 7\].  
* **Accreditation Dynamics:** Potential tension between meeting traditional professional accreditation standards and rapidly integrating novel AI/ML into required coursework for specific programs \[Insight 1\].

**D. Future Directions/Recommendations**

Based on the analysis, several potential pathways could further enhance AI integration within UBC Forestry and related environmental programs:

* **Curriculum Evolution:**  
  * Introduce foundational computational thinking and data science principles earlier in undergraduate Forestry programs.  
  * Develop elective streams, minors, or certificates within Forestry focusing specifically on AI/ML applications in forest management, conservation, wood science, or environmental monitoring.
