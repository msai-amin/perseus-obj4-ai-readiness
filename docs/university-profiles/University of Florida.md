## **3 Curriculum Deep Dive: Integrating Computational and Quantitative Skills**

A critical aspect of preparing students to address contemporary environmental and natural resource challenges involves equipping them with strong quantitative and computational skills. UF's curriculum reflects this need, offering various pathways for students to develop proficiency in areas like statistics, GIS, modeling, and data science.

* **Foundational Quantitative Literacy:** A baseline level of quantitative understanding is required across the relevant undergraduate programs. Majors such as Forest Resources and Conservation (FRC), Natural Resource Conservation (NRC), and Environmental Science (EVS) typically mandate foundational mathematics, often College Algebra (MAC 1105\) or Precalculus 14, and an introductory statistics course, commonly STA 2023 Introduction to Statistics 1\.13  
  * However, the intensity of mathematical preparation varies. The BS in Environmental Science demands a higher level of mathematical proficiency (Introduction to Calculus) compared to the BA track (College Algebra).9 More specialized quantitative majors, such as the BS in Statistics or the BS in Data Science offered through the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences (CLAS), require a more rigorous sequence, including multiple semesters of calculus (MAC 2311, MAC 2312, MAC 2313\) and linear algebra (e.g., MAS 3114, MAS 4115).30 This tiered structure in quantitative prerequisites allows students to select programs that align with their mathematical aptitude and career aspirations, while ensuring a minimum level of numeracy across the environmental and natural resource disciplines.  
* **Program-Specific Computational and Quantitative Content:** Beyond foundational courses, specific majors integrate computational and quantitative methods relevant to their disciplines:  
  * **Forest Resources & Conservation (FRC):** The curriculum includes FNR 3410C Natural Resource Sampling, a course focused on quantitative data collection and analysis techniques essential for resource assessment.13 Furthermore, the program's stated learning outcomes explicitly include the ability to "Analyze, interpret, synthesize, and communicate information and data, including the use of mathematical and statistical methods".13 At the graduate level, the program offers dedicated study areas in biometrics, GIS, remote sensing, and modeling.12 Courses like FNR 5405 Forest Resources Information Systems provide practical GIS training.34  
  * **Environmental Science (EVS):** The BS degree incorporates a core requirement in "Methods and Technology," distinct from the BA.9 The senior capstone course, EVS 4021 Critical Thinking in Environmental Science, requires students to synthesize information across physical, biological, and social systems, often involving data interpretation and analysis.9 Notably, an upper-level elective, EVS 4932 Environmental Data Science, has been developed to introduce students to data literacy, GIS, spatial analysis, the R statistical programming language, Python programming, and fundamental AI concepts.36  
  * **Geomatics:** This field is inherently quantitative and computational. The curriculum focuses on the theory and application of measurement science, spatial data analysis, GPS technology, GIS, digital mapping, remote sensing (including satellite, airborne, and UAS platforms), and Lidar.7 Specific courses include SUR 5365 Digital Mapping, SUR 5386 Image Processing for Remote Sensing 37, SUR 6395 Topics in GIS 34, and SUR 6535 GPS-INS Integration.34  
  * **Natural Resource Conservation (NRC):** The major's core curriculum explicitly includes categories for "Quantitative Analysis & Assessment" and "Spatial Analysis," ensuring students gain exposure to these critical skill sets.20 Like FRC, it requires FNR 3410C Natural Resource Sampling.20  
  * **Fisheries & Aquatic Sciences (FAS):** Graduate programs incorporate quantitative biology.12 Specific courses like FAS 5335C Applied Fisheries Statistics are available 37, and a dedicated graduate certificate in Quantitative Fisheries Science is offered.12  
  * **Agricultural & Biological Engineering (ABE):** This department offers courses directly relevant and tagged with the AI attribute, such as ABE 4662 Quantification of Biological Processes 38 and AOM 4434 Precision Agriculture, which covers GPS, GIS, variable rate technologies (VRT), and data management.39 ABE 5643C Biological Systems Modeling is also available as a graduate option for SNRE students.37  
  * **Soil, Water, and Ecosystem Sciences (SWES):** Offers SWS 5721C GIS in Land Resource Management.37  
* **AI, Machine Learning, and Data Science Course Access:** UF provides several avenues for students in environmental and agricultural programs to access specific training in AI, ML, and data science:

Syllabi for ALS 3200C and AOM 4434 were not found among the Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE) department's listed syllabi.40  
  * **University-Wide Programs:** The UF AI Fundamentals Certificate is open to all undergraduate majors and provides a structured three-course sequence covering AI fundamentals, ethics (PHI 3681 Ethics, Data, and Technology), and an applied AI course relevant to the student's field.2 The BS in Data Science (CLAS) offers comprehensive training in statistics, mathematics, and computer science, including courses like STA 4241 Statistical Learning in R, STA 4273 Statistical Computing in R, COP 3530 Data Structures and Algorithms, and CIS 4301 Information and Database Systems.30 The BS in Statistics (CLAS) provides a strong theoretical and applied foundation, with electives in statistical learning and computing, and requires a programming elective.31  
  * **CISE and Statistics Department Courses:** Numerous relevant courses are offered by the CISE and Statistics departments (see Table 1 below). While highly valuable, accessing upper-level courses often requires fulfilling substantial prerequisite sequences in mathematics (calculus, linear algebra, discrete math) and programming (fundamentals, data structures) 43, which may pose a challenge for students not majoring or minoring in these fields. CISE offers minors for non-majors.44  
  * **UF Informatics Institute (UFII/AIIRI):** Primarily a research entity 47, the institute may offer specialized workshops or training opportunities, complementing formal coursework.49  
* **Relevant Minors and Certificates:** Beyond the AI Fundamentals certificate, students can specialize through various minors and certificates:  
  * **Geospatial:** Geomatics Certificate (Undergrad) 12, Mapping with Small Unmanned Aerial Systems Certificate (Undergrad/Grad) 12, Geospatial Analysis Certificate (Grad) 12, GEO:AI Undergraduate Certificate (Geography).50  
  * **Quantitative/Data Science:** Quantitative Fisheries Science Certificate (Grad) 12, Data Analytics Certificate (Undergrad) 30, Computer and Information Science and Engineering Minor 44, Statistics Minor 30, Data Analytics for Applied Economics and Agribusiness Minor.13

The landscape of computational and quantitative training at UF offers considerable flexibility. Students in environmental and natural resource programs have access to foundational training within their majors, can deepen their expertise through specialized certificates and minors, or pursue more intensive training via dedicated quantitative majors or graduate programs. The creation of college-specific AI courses (like ALS 3200C) and the university-wide AI Fundamentals Certificate represent key strategies for broadening AI literacy and skills across disciplines, including forestry, conservation, and environmental science.
