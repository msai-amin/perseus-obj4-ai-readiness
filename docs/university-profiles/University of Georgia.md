## **8\. Research Integrity and Ethics**

The University of Georgia upholds standards for research integrity and is actively developing frameworks to address the ethical considerations of emerging technologies like artificial intelligence.

### **8.1. Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR)**

UGA has established policies and training mechanisms to ensure the responsible conduct of research, largely driven by federal funding agency requirements.

* **Mandatory Training:** RCR training is required for researchers, students, and staff involved in projects funded by agencies such as the National Science Foundation (NSF), the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), and Public Health Service (PHS) agencies (including NIH, CDC, FDA, etc.).193 Specific requirements vary by agency.  
* **Training Delivery Methods:** UGA primarily utilizes the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) Program for online RCR training modules, accessed through the university's Professional Education Portal (PEP).194 A specific online course, "Responsible Conduct of Research at UGA," is designated for those funded by NSF or USDA-NIFA.194 However, agencies like NIH typically require an in-person or live training component.196 This requirement is often fulfilled at UGA through enrollment in GRSC 8550 *Responsible Conduct of Research and Scholarship*, a discussion-based graduate course covering key ethical topics.194 Equivalent departmental courses (e.g., CBIO 8080, GENE 8650, VETM 8550, PMCY/PHAR 7230\) may also satisfy this requirement.194 Some departments, like Microbiology, mandate GRSC 8550 for all their graduate students.199  
* **Content and Scope:** RCR training covers core norms and principles governing research practice, including data acquisition and management, authorship and publication practices, peer review, mentorship, conflicts of interest, collaborative research, research misconduct, and the societal impact of research.196 Discipline-specific ethics training is also available, such as Warnell's online *Forestry Ethics* course designed for professional foresters seeking Continuing Forestry Education (CFE) credits 77, and the Odum School's *Environmental Ethics Certificate Program*.82 Human subjects research requires separate, specific CITI training.197  
* **Frequency:** RCR training is not a one-time event. Refresher training is necessary, with frequency dictated by funding agency policies (e.g., NIH requires training at least once per career stage and no less than every four years).194

UGA employs a structured, multi-modal approach to RCR training, leveraging the standardized CITI platform for online content delivery and specific graduate courses for required live instruction, thereby ensuring compliance with major federal funding mandates. This framework is supplemented by discipline-specific ethics education in areas like forestry and environmental ethics.

### **8.2. AI Ethics**

As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly integrated into research and academic life, UGA is developing policies and educational resources to promote its ethical and responsible use, operating within guidelines set by the University System of Georgia (USG).

* **USG Mandate:** The USG Board of Regents requires all system institutions, including UGA, to establish policies governing the ethical, responsible, and secure use of AI in academic settings.200 These institutional policies must address the definition and scope of AI, ethical principles, accountability, faculty/staff/student education on AI ethics and risks, data privacy and security, human oversight in research, responsible use in scholarly communication, and designated points of contact.200 These policies must align with USG IT and Academic Affairs handbook guidelines and be integrated into existing academic integrity codes.200  
* **UGA Implementation and Education:** UGA is actively incorporating AI ethics into its programs and research initiatives. The Institute for Artificial Intelligence offers ARTI(PHIL) 4340/6340 *Ethics and AI*, a course available at both undergraduate and graduate levels.158 The Ph.D. program in Artificial Intelligence explicitly includes AI ethics and policy as a potential area of research expertise.22 The Presidential Hiring Initiative cluster focused on *Ethics, Data, and AI* brings together faculty from Philosophy, MIS, Theater/Film, and Art to research issues of bias, fairness, accountability, privacy, and governance in AI and data science.31 UGA's participation in the NextGenAI consortium with OpenAI also involves exploring the broader implications and responsible application of AI technologies.29 Guidance is also available from the state level, such as Georgia's AI Ethics Framework, which emphasizes values like adaptability, commitment, curiosity, growth, and innovation in evaluating AI tools.201

UGA is navigating the complex landscape of AI ethics within a framework mandated by the USG. This involves developing institutional policies while simultaneously fostering education and research on the topic through dedicated courses, faculty expertise recruited via strategic hiring initiatives, and participation in national dialogues. The focus is on ensuring responsible innovation, addressing potential biases, safeguarding privacy and security, and maintaining human oversight in the application of AI technologies across academic and research domains.
