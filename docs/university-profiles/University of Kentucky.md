The Center for Applied AI (CAAI), housed within the Institute for Biomedical Informatics (IBI), is a major driver of AI research and application in the healthcare domain.19 Leveraging its strong foundation in handling highly regulated medical data, CAAI emphasizes systematic data curation and methodical evaluations to develop trusted AI systems. This expertise is critical for ensuring the reliability and ethical use of AI in medicine. Specific CAAI projects demonstrate concrete applications of AI, particularly Natural Language Processing (NLP) and LLMs, in the biomedical field. These include initiatives focused on clinical trial matching, the development of conversational AI agents for medical education settings, tools for parsing MedImpact reports, and methods for extracting pathology condition codes from textual medical records. These examples highlight the significant impact AI is beginning to have on improving health outcomes, streamlining medical research processes, and enhancing medical education at UK.

### **C. Expertise in Enabling Computational Techniques (GIS, Advanced Statistics, HPC)**

The successful application of AI across diverse disciplines relies heavily on underlying expertise in enabling computational techniques. Faculty at UK possess significant strengths in these areas. As previously noted, faculty in Forestry (such as Dr. Jian Yang 16) and in the NRES program (instructors of courses like NRE 355 14) are actively teaching and utilizing GIS and spatial analysis in their research and curriculum. This expertise is crucial for handling and interpreting the spatially explicit data common in environmental and agricultural sciences.

Similarly, faculty within the Department of Statistics, including Dr. Derek Young 35 and Professor William Rayens 37, contribute deep knowledge in advanced statistical modeling, computational statistics, and multivariate analysis. These statistical methodologies are foundational to the development and validation of many machine learning algorithms and AI models.

Supporting all computationally intensive research, including AI, is the Research Computing Infrastructure (RCI) team and the Center for Computational Sciences (CCS), which provide essential consulting and support for accessing and utilizing UK's high-performance computing resources.21 The availability of faculty and staff expertise in these enabling computational areas—GIS, advanced statistics, and HPC—is critical. These experts not only conduct their own cutting-edge research but also play a crucial role in training students and assisting researchers from other disciplines in effectively using these powerful tools, thereby amplifying the impact of AI across the university.

A clear pattern of a symbiotic relationship between core AI methodologists and applied domain experts is evident at the University of Kentucky. Core AI researchers in Computer Science and Statistics (such as Dr. Silvestri, Dr. Young, and CS faculty involved in projects like CLIMBS) are frequently found collaborating with, or providing foundational tools and methods for, domain specialists in fields like Forestry and Natural Resources, Agriculture, and Medicine.20 For example, CS faculty contribute AI expertise to the environmentally focused CLIMBS project, and CAAI, with its cadre of AI specialists, partners with the College of Agriculture to develop the AgriGuide tool. Concurrently, domain experts in fields like Forestry and Natural Resources (e.g., Dr. Yang, Dr. Liang) are adept at utilizing advanced computational methods such as GIS, remote sensing, and sophisticated modeling techniques, often generating the complex datasets and posing the challenging questions that drive AI innovation.16 This dynamic interplay is essential for impactful AI research: core AI researchers provide the methodological advancements and computational tools, while domain experts contribute critical contextual knowledge, unique datasets, and compelling real-world problems that test and refine these AI approaches. This collaborative model is crucial because AI methods are often best developed and validated through practical application, and conversely, research in applied domains can be significantly advanced by the power of AI. The strength of UK's AI research is therefore amplified by this deeply interdisciplinary approach, enabling the institution to address more complex and societally relevant challenges than would be possible if AI research were confined to a single department or pursued in isolation from applied fields.

## **V. High-Performance Computing and Data Infrastructure for AI Research**

The advancement of Artificial Intelligence research at the University of Kentucky is critically dependent on robust high-performance computing (HPC) resources, specialized hardware for AI workloads, comprehensive software support, and well-defined access mechanisms. The university, primarily through its Center for Computational Sciences (CCS), provides a multi-faceted infrastructure designed to meet these demanding computational needs.

### **A. Overview of UK's HPC Clusters (Lipscomb Compute Cluster, Morgan Compute Cluster)**

The Center for Computational Sciences (CCS) is the primary provider of centralized HPC resources at UK. Among its key offerings is the **Lipscomb Compute Cluster (LCC)**, which became operational in late fall 2019, succeeding earlier HPC systems and marking a significant upgrade in computational capacity.22 The LCC is built with multiple generations of Intel CPU processors and was designed with modern research needs in mind, including integration for web-based access and options for high-speed data transfer nodes, facilitating efficient data movement for large-scale computations.51

In addition to the LCC, CCS also offers the **Morgan Compute Cluster (MCC)**. The MCC distinguishes itself by being built on an AMD chipset and utilizing AMD Rome processors. The availability of multiple HPC clusters featuring different processor architectures (Intel for LCC, AMD for MCC) provides researchers with valuable flexibility. This allows them to select the platform best suited for their specific computational workloads, which can vary significantly in AI model training, data preprocessing, and large-scale simulations. This diversity in hardware contributes to a more resilient and adaptable HPC environment capable of supporting a broader range of scientific and engineering research, including the diverse computational demands of AI.

### **B. GPU Capabilities and Specialized AI Hardware**

Recognizing the critical role of specialized hardware for accelerating AI research, particularly in deep learning, UK has invested in Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) capabilities. The Lipscomb Compute Cluster (LCC) is equipped with "the latest accelerator cards from NVIDIA." These GPUs are explicitly targeted not only for traditional science and engineering simulations but also specifically for "machine-learning workloads".51 While the specific NVIDIA GPU models (e.g., A100, V100) and their quantities are not detailed in the high-level summaries available, their confirmed presence is a key indicator of the university's commitment to supporting AI research. Furthermore, the Center for Computational Sciences (CCS) lists a "GPU facility" as part of its offerings 7, suggesting dedicated infrastructure or a significant allocation of GPU resources for computationally intensive tasks common in AI.

Beyond the general HPC resources, the Center for Applied AI (CAAI) maintains its own specialized computational infrastructure. CAAI reports that the majority of its "data, computational processing, and operational services are maintained within in highly secure facilities that we operate".19 Significantly, CAAI lists a "DGX Cluster" under its Large Language Model projects. NVIDIA DGX systems are purpose-built for AI and deep learning, offering substantial computational power optimized for training large and complex models. The presence of a DGX cluster within CAAI represents a strategic investment in high-end AI computational capabilities, particularly crucial for their work in developing and fine-tuning Large Language Models and other advanced AI applications. CAAI's operation of independent, secure facilities also points to a tailored infrastructure designed to meet the specific and often sensitive demands of their AI research, especially given their origins in biomedical informatics.

The University of Kentucky appears to provide a tiered system for accessing AI-optimized computing resources. At a broad level, the Center for Computational Sciences (CCS) offers general-purpose High-Performance Computing (HPC) clusters, such as the LCC and MCC, which are equipped with GPUs suitable for a wide range of research applications, including many machine learning tasks.7 This makes AI-capable hardware accessible to a large segment of the university's research community. Concurrently, specialized units like the Center for Applied AI (CAAI), which are deeply involved in cutting-edge AI development such as Large Language Models, operate their own, potentially more powerful and customized resources, exemplified by their DGX cluster.19 This tiered structure suggests a strategic allocation of computational assets: broadly available HPC resources cater to general AI research needs, while high-end, specialized hardware is managed by dedicated AI centers for pioneering AI model development and computationally intensive projects. This approach allows UK to support a wide spectrum of AI research activities, from individual principal investigators applying machine learning techniques on general HPC systems to specialized teams building and training large-scale AI models on dedicated, state-of-the-art hardware. Such a model optimizes resource allocation based on the varying computational demands and the specific focus of different research projects and teams.

### **C. Supported AI/ML Software Stacks (Python, R, TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.) and Development Environments (Jupyter)**

Effective AI research necessitates access to a comprehensive suite of software tools and development environments. While detailed software inventories like the "LCC Software List" 52 and the "HPC Software Info" page 53 (though the latter was inaccessible in the provided search results) would offer exhaustive specifics, the available information strongly indicates robust support for common AI/ML software stacks.

Jupyter Notebooks, a standard interactive development environment for AI/ML and data analysis, are explicitly supported on the LCC.54 Researchers have multiple options for using Jupyter, including installing it within their personal LCC accounts using Miniconda/conda or utilizing pre-existing Jupyter containers designed for both CPU and GPU workloads. Interactive access is facilitated through Open OnDemand, enhancing usability.54 The support for conda is particularly important as it allows users to create and manage their own isolated Python and R environments, installing specific versions of libraries and packages required for their research, which is crucial for reproducibility and avoiding conflicts.

The R programming language, widely used in statistical computing and machine learning, is also a supported and taught language at UK. For instance, the Master of Applied Statistics curriculum includes STA 651 (Advanced Programming with R) 5, indicating its integration into formal academic training.

The extensive AI and ML research activities across the university, such as the CLIMBS project's explicit application of AI/ML techniques 17 and CAAI's specialization in LLMs, computer vision, and ML 19, inherently imply the availability and proficient use of relevant software stacks. These would typically include Python as the dominant language for AI development, along with its rich ecosystem of libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and major deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch. While specific versions are not enumerated in the provided snippets, the active and advanced nature of the AI research being conducted necessitates that these standard tools are readily available and supported on UK's HPC infrastructure. The LCC Software List 52 would be the definitive resource for specific package availability and versioning.

### **D. Data Storage, Management, and Access Policies for Researchers**

AI research is often characterized by the use of large and complex datasets, making robust data storage and management capabilities essential. The Center for Computational Sciences (CCS) addresses this need by offering a variety of storage solutions. These range from high-performance storage systems designed for active data access during computation to long-term archival storage, with a total raw storage capacity reported to be over 12 Petabytes.22 This substantial capacity is critical for supporting AI research projects that involve massive datasets for training and validating models.

Access to these HPC resources, including computational power and storage, is managed through a formal request process for UK-affiliated users. Researchers, particularly first-time Principal Investigators (PIs), are required to submit a request via an online support portal. This process involves completing a questionnaire that details the project's objectives, the research group's activities on the cluster, the computational methodologies to be employed, specific software needs, and an initial estimate of resource requirements, including core hours, storage space, and CPU/GPU needs.55 This structured application process ensures that resources are allocated based on project needs and scientific merit.

Beyond general HPC data storage, specialized centers like CAAI have developed more tailored data management practices. CAAI emphasizes systematic data curation and methodical evaluations, with the majority of its data and computational processing maintained within highly secure facilities that it operates directly.19 This approach is particularly informed by CAAI's foundational work with regulated medical data, instilling a strong commitment to data security, privacy, and integrity—principles that are increasingly important for all types of AI research involving sensitive or proprietary information.

The increasing scale and complexity of data used in AI research, as exemplified by the "multidisciplinary big data learning" approach of the CLIMBS project 17 and the secure data handling practices at CAAI 19, suggest an evolving landscape of data governance and management at the University of Kentucky. While CCS provides large-scale general storage solutions 22, the specialized requirements of AI research—particularly projects involving sensitive information (like medical records handled by CAAI) or extremely large and diverse datasets (like the environmental data in CLIMBS)—necessitate more than just bulk storage capacity. These projects demand robust data management protocols, stringent security measures, and dedicated curation practices. It appears that UK is addressing this by developing or having already implemented specialized data handling infrastructure and protocols within specific AI-focused units like CAAI. This tailored approach meets the unique demands of AI research, which often differ significantly from general research data management needs. As artificial intelligence becomes more pervasive across disciplines, the university will likely need to continue refining and expanding its data governance frameworks to comprehensively address the ethical, privacy, and security challenges associated with a wide array of AI datasets, thereby ensuring compliance, fostering trust, and promoting responsible innovation.

## **VI. Strategic Vision: AI as a University Research Priority**

The University of Kentucky is increasingly positioning Artificial Intelligence and related data-intensive methodologies as central to its overarching research strategy. This strategic vision is not confined to a single department but permeates university-wide planning, influences college-specific initiatives, and drives efforts to cultivate AI literacy across the campus community.

### **A. Alignment with University-Wide Strategic Research Plan (Emphasis on Data Science and Convergent Research)**

The University of Kentucky's commitment to advancing research is evident in its strategic planning documents. The Research Strategic Plan for 2015–2020, and the momentum carried forward from it, included a core objective to expand scholarship and research across all disciplines, with a particular focus on addressing the most significant challenges facing the Commonwealth of Kentucky, the nation, and the world.56 This period saw notable growth in grant and contract awards and in research and development expenditures, significantly exceeding initial targets.56

Central to the university's evolving research strategy is Goal 1.3: "Facilitate Big Data analytic hub/convergent research".56 This goal explicitly underscores the importance of data science and computationally intensive research, which are integral to AI. Associated action items include conducting a campus-wide inventory of existing expertise in these areas, identifying opportunities for research growth that foster the convergence of computational work and data science, and actively facilitating the development of applications for funding opportunities in data science and related major instrumentation or facility grants.56 This strategic focus indicates a clear recognition of data science as a pivotal enabling capability for future research breakthroughs.

The university leadership is also cognizant of the significant growth in AI-related grants and the numerous opportunities for securing expanded research funding in AI from nearly every federal agency, as well as through philanthropic channels.29 There is a stated aim to harness and focus UK's strengths to fully embrace and utilize AI technology. This is not only to advance the university's mission of facilitating learning and expanding knowledge but also to better serve the global community by discovering, disseminating, sharing, and applying new knowledge derived from AI-driven research.29 Further demonstrating UK's leadership in this domain, experts from the university led the 2025 Research Analytics Summit, a national event that brought together professionals to explore innovative strategies in research analytics, bibliometrics, responsible research evaluation, and the use of AI within the research enterprise.59 This initiative highlights UK's role in shaping national conversations about data-informed decision-making and the strategic integration of AI in research.

The University of Kentucky's strategic plan thoughtfully positions "Big Data analytic hub/convergent research" 56 not as an isolated objective focused solely on AI, but rather as a powerful, cross-cutting enabler designed to bolster its seven established Research Priority Areas (RPAs). These RPAs, which include Cancer, Cardiovascular Diseases, Diabetes & Obesity, Energy, Materials Science, Neuroscience, Substance Use Disorder, and the UNITE (diversity and inclusion) initiative 29, represent the university's commitment to addressing major societal challenges. The development and application of AI and data science capabilities are envisioned as critical tools to accelerate discovery and innovation across these diverse and strategically important fields. For example, AI can be instrumental in analyzing vast genomic datasets in cancer research, modeling complex energy systems, understanding intricate neurological disorders, or identifying patterns in substance use disorder data. This strategic alignment ensures that AI development at UK is largely demand-driven, directly supporting existing research strengths and contributing to solutions for pressing societal problems. By embedding AI within these broader priorities, the university promotes the practical application of AI methodologies rather than their purely theoretical exploration, thereby increasing the likelihood of generating impactful and translatable research outcomes. This approach leverages AI as a transformative technology to enhance the quality, scope, and impact of research across the entire institution.

### **B. College-Specific AI Strategies and Investments (Engineering, Arts & Sciences, Agriculture, Food & Environment)**

While a university-wide strategic emphasis on AI and data science provides overarching direction, individual colleges at the University of Kentucky are also proactively developing and implementing their own AI-related strategies and making specific investments. This decentralized approach allows for tailored initiatives that address the unique needs and opportunities within different disciplines.

The Pigman College of Engineering, through its Department of Computer Science, has been a key driver in AI education. A prominent example is the launch of the undergraduate Artificial Intelligence (AI) Certificate in Fall 2024\.1 This certificate program is notably open to all UK students, reflecting a commitment from the College of Engineering to promote AI literacy broadly across the campus, beyond its own student body. This initiative represents a direct investment in building foundational AI skills.

The College of Arts & Sciences has also taken a leading role in fostering an AI ecosystem. It is a key partner, along with the Gatton College of Business and Economics and the Pigman College of Engineering, in the UK Hub for AI/ML.23 This collaborative hub aims to transform both educational and research capacity in AI and machine learning by connecting researchers, supporting infrastructure development, and facilitating interdisciplinary projects. This demonstrates a proactive, cross-college effort to build a vibrant and supportive AI community.

The Martin-Gatton College of Agriculture, Food and Environment is actively embracing AI to enhance its domain-specific research and outreach. A significant example is its collaboration with the Center for Applied AI (CAAI) to develop AgriGuide, an AI-powered tool designed to harness and disseminate agricultural knowledge.19 This project indicates a college-level commitment to leveraging advanced AI technologies for innovation within the agricultural sector. The college's earlier strategic plan (2015-2020) also emphasized preparing graduates for a global economy and producing innovative solutions through multidisciplinary collaborations 60, goals that align well with the adoption and integration of AI.

Even in departments with a longer history of computational applications, strategic thinking has paved the way for AI integration. For instance, the Department of Forestry and Natural Resources' strategic planning efforts from 2015-2016 focused on improving facilities for laboratories, enhancing research capabilities (such as through the Forest Health Research and Education Center), and strengthening interdisciplinary programs like NRES, which already incorporates a Geospatial Analysis skill area.12 While this planning predates the most recent surge in AI, the focus on building strong data and analytical capabilities provides a solid foundation for the subsequent adoption of more advanced computational methods, including AI, in forestry and environmental science.12

The emergence of these college-specific AI initiatives, alongside the university's centralized strategy, points to a dynamic and effective model for fostering AI innovation. While the overarching university research plan champions Big Data and Data Science as key priorities 56, individual colleges are not merely waiting for top-down directives. Instead, they are proactively developing educational programs like the AI Certificate by the College of Engineering 2, establishing research hubs such as the Arts & Sciences AI/ML Hub 23, and spearheading applied AI projects like AgriGuide by the College of Agriculture.20 This pattern suggests a model where centralized strategic vision and resources (like CAAI and CCS) enable and encourage decentralized, discipline-specific innovation in AI. Colleges are empowered to develop initiatives that are most relevant to their fields, fostering a sense of ownership and ensuring that AI applications are closely aligned with specific academic and research needs. This dual approach—combining centralized strategic guidance with decentralized execution—can be highly effective. It allows for both a cohesive university-wide direction in AI and the flexibility for tailored, discipline-specific adoption and innovation. Such a model is likely to lead to a more resilient, diverse, and impactful AI ecosystem at UK, as different colleges can experiment with and develop AI applications best suited to their unique strengths and challenges, rather than adhering to a one-size-fits-all mandate.

### **C. Fostering AI Literacy and Developing a Future-Ready AI Workforce**

A critical component of the University of Kentucky's AI strategy is the commitment to fostering widespread AI literacy and developing a workforce equipped for an AI-driven future. This extends beyond training AI specialists to ensuring that students from all disciplines gain a fundamental understanding of AI's capabilities, implications, and ethical considerations.

The new undergraduate AI Certificate explicitly aims to "arm students with the AI literacy necessary in today's world".1 This program's accessibility to students from all UK colleges is a key element in achieving this broad literacy goal. Further supporting early exposure to AI concepts, the Computer Science course CS 263 "AI in the World" is designed for all first-year undergraduates. It focuses on what AI is, its societal impact, and ethical dimensions, rather than intricate technical details, making it an ideal entry point for students from non-technical backgrounds.2

The Center for Applied AI (CAAI) also plays a role in workforce development by supporting UK's mission to develop the future workforce and by guiding collaborators through AI technical barriers, helping them to rapidly prototype ideas and understand AI applications.19 This hands-on support helps to upskill researchers and staff across the university.

Efforts to build an AI-ready talent pipeline also extend to pre-college levels and focus on inclusivity. The CLIMBS project, for example, includes a "Learning Hub Scholars program" designed to provide experiential learning opportunities for students from underrepresented backgrounds, encouraging them to pursue advanced degrees in earth and atmospheric science and engineering.17 Additionally, its "Enviropods summer day camps" target K-12 students to stimulate interest in climate-related STEM careers, which increasingly involve data science and AI.17 These initiatives are crucial for building a diverse and sustainable pipeline of talent for AI and related STEM fields.

The regional context also highlights a growing emphasis on AI skills. Kentucky State University, an 1890 Land-grant institution, secured USDA funding for a project aimed at preparing an "agricultural intelligence (AI) workforce".50 This initiative includes enhancing the environmental science curriculum by providing a wider scope of environmental and geospatial science courses and experiential learning opportunities for undergraduate students.50 While this is a separate institution, such regional activity underscores the increasing demand for an AI-skilled agricultural workforce, an area where UK's programs and research can offer complementary strengths and potential collaborations. Collectively, these diverse efforts—from broad AI literacy courses and specialized certificates to targeted workforce development programs and K-12 outreach—demonstrate a comprehensive approach to preparing students and the broader community for the opportunities and challenges presented by the proliferation of AI technologies.

## **VII. Advancing Responsible and Ethical AI: Policies and Governance**

As the University of Kentucky expands its research and educational activities in Artificial Intelligence, it is concurrently developing frameworks, policies, and training mechanisms to ensure the responsible and ethical development and application of AI technologies. This commitment is crucial for maintaining research integrity, protecting individuals, and fostering public trust in AI.

### **A. UK ADVANCE Recommendations for Generative AI in Research**

A key initiative in guiding the ethical use of AI is UK ADVANCE, a transdisciplinary group composed of experts from multiple departments and offices. This group has been tasked with examining the implications of generative AI tools like ChatGPT for higher education and research, and has developed recommendations and guidelines for the campus community.29

Central to the UK ADVANCE recommendations is the principle of researcher accountability. The guidelines emphasize that researchers are ultimately responsible for any content generated by AI tools, including verifying its accuracy and originality, and ensuring it is free from plagiarism.58 A significant directive is that generative AI cannot be listed as an author on research publications, as AI tools cannot be held accountable for research misconduct or intellectual property misuse, nor can they fulfill standard authorship criteria such as taking responsibility for the work or managing conflicts of interest.58

The guidance also highlights the known limitations of generative AI, such as the potential for "hallucinations" (generating false or inaccurate information) and inherent biases derived from training data. Researchers are advised to critically evaluate all AI-generated content and to consult disciplinary authorities, funding agencies, and publication outlets for context-specific standards regarding the appropriate use of generative AI in their specific field.58 For academic milestones such as theses, dissertations, and comprehensive exams, the use of generative AI must align with departmental, college, and Graduate School requirements, as well as the guidance of the student's advisor.58 These recommendations provide a foundational framework for the UK research community, promoting a culture of critical engagement with AI tools while upholding core principles of research integrity.

### **B. Institutional Guidelines for AI in Teaching and Learning**

In parallel with research guidelines, the University of Kentucky, through its Center for the Enhancement of Learning and Teaching (CELT), provides extensive guidance and example policies for instructors regarding the use of generative AI in teaching and learning contexts.62 CELT has been highly active, conducting numerous consultations and workshops since early 2023 to advise the UK community on the ethical and effective integration of generative AI in education.62

The approach advocated by CELT is one of flexibility, encouraging instructors to develop AI course policies that are appropriate for their specific course learning objectives, content, and disciplinary norms.64 These policies can span a spectrum: some instructors may opt for a "no AI use" policy if generative AI is deemed detrimental to achieving learning outcomes, particularly those emphasizing original analytical thinking and critical analysis.64 In such cases, the rationale for the prohibition should be clearly communicated to students. Other policies may permit "restricted use" of AI for specific tasks, such as idea generation, brainstorming, or proofreading, while prohibiting its use for drafting or content generation.64 Some courses might even embrace "unrestricted use" to allow students to explore AI capabilities, but this typically comes with stringent requirements for disclosure, proper citation (including acknowledgment statements detailing how AI was used), and critical evaluation of AI outputs.64

Regardless of the specific policy adopted, CELT recommends that syllabi include a clear definition of generative AI, the rationale behind the chosen policy, and explicit expectations for citing any use of AI tools.64 A crucial point emphasized is that students remain responsible for the factual accuracy and quality of any AI-generated content they submit, and they must be made aware of AI's propensity for "hallucinations" or generating misleading information.64 Faculty are also encouraged to enhance their own AI literacy through training and professional development. Furthermore, guidelines suggest that AI should not be used to generate official communications (like syllabi or recommendation letters) in a way that misrepresents faculty authorship, ensuring authenticity in professional interactions.62 This adaptable, guidance-based approach empowers instructors to make informed decisions about AI in their classrooms while upholding academic integrity and promoting transparency.

### **C. Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) in the Age of AI**

The University of Kentucky mandates Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) training for all individuals involved in research and scholarly activity. This training program, which includes online modules via the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) Program and in-person discussion sessions, is founded on core values such as honesty, accuracy, efficiency, and objectivity.62 These values are directly applicable to the ethical considerations surrounding the use of AI in research.

Recognizing the growing impact of artificial intelligence, UK has begun to integrate AI-specific ethical considerations into its existing RCR framework. Notably, the in-person RCR training sessions now incorporate case studies and discussions related to AI.62 This integration ensures that researchers are prompted to think critically about the responsible use of AI tools within the broader context of research integrity, addressing issues such as data provenance, algorithmic bias, authorship, and the potential for misuse of AI-generated content. By embedding AI ethics into the established RCR program, the university aims to equip its research community with the awareness and tools necessary to navigate the ethical complexities introduced by these rapidly evolving technologies.

### **D. Data Privacy, Security, and Intellectual Property Considerations**

The proliferation of AI tools, particularly generative AI, raises significant concerns regarding data privacy, security, and intellectual property, which the University of Kentucky is actively addressing. UK ADVANCE guidelines specifically caution against inputting sensitive information, such as student education records protected by FERPA or confidential protected research data, into generative AI tools unless these tools have been thoroughly vetted and formally approved by the University for data privacy and other governance issues.63 This is because many publicly available generative AI tools do not offer guarantees for the protection of private or confidential data, and information entered into them may be used for further model training or become otherwise exposed.63

The Center for Applied AI (CAAI), given its extensive work with sensitive medical data, exemplifies a commitment to robust data security. CAAI maintains its data and computational processing primarily within its own highly secure facilities, adhering to stringent protocols to protect information.19 This practice underscores the importance of controlled environments when working with AI and sensitive datasets.

Intellectual property is another area of concern. UK ADVANCE highlights that generative AI tools often paraphrase content from a multitude of sources, which can raise issues related to plagiarism and copyright infringement. Furthermore, these tools have been found to cite incorrect sources or even fabricate references, necessitating careful verification by the researcher.58

To build foundational knowledge in these areas, the UK Department of Computer Science offers CS 509 (Computer Ethics). This course, which is a required component of the undergraduate AI Certificate 2, covers critical topics such as professional ethics, data privacy, and the broader societal impacts of technology, including AI.2 These various measures—from specific data handling warnings and secure infrastructure development to the integration of ethics into the curriculum—demonstrate the university's awareness of and proactive stance on the critical issues of data security, privacy, and intellectual property in the context of AI. This multifaceted approach aims to foster a research and learning environment where AI is used powerfully, yet responsibly.

The University of Kentucky's strategy for AI ethics and governance is characterized by a multi-layered and adaptive approach, rather than a single, static policy. This involves university-level recommendations for research practices issued by UK ADVANCE 58, flexible and adaptable course-level policies guided by CELT to suit diverse pedagogical needs 64, the direct integration of AI ethics into the mandatory Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) training program 62, and foundational ethics education embedded within relevant curricula, such as the AI Certificate's requirement for a computer ethics course.2 This comprehensive strategy reflects a nuanced understanding of AI's rapidly evolving nature and the varied ways it impacts different academic disciplines and university functions.
