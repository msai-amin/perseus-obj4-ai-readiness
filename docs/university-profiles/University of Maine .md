## **Strategic Vision: AI in UMaine's Institutional Priorities**

The University of Maine's engagement with Artificial Intelligence is increasingly framed within its broader institutional strategic priorities and those of the University of Maine System (UMS). This alignment ensures that AI research and education contribute to overarching goals related to workforce development, economic impact, and service to the State of Maine.

**A. University of Maine System (UMS) Strategic Priorities**

The UMS adopted a Declaration of Strategic Priorities in December 2018, primarily focused on addressing Maine's acute workforce challenges, meeting evolving student and employer expectations for post-secondary education, and ensuring affordable access to market-responsive academic programs.7 The declaration envisions an "employer-engaged, efficient and cost-effective continuum of public education" designed to provide Mainers with flexible, relevant learning opportunities throughout their lives.7 These priorities support existing university objectives, such as plans to significantly increase enrollment in high-demand fields like nursing and engineering to address critical workforce shortages.7 There is also a strong emphasis on catering to the needs of Maine's adult learner population and aligning university programming with their requirements and those of their employers. As part of this effort, the UMS is a founding member of the MaineSpark coalition, which aims for 60% of Mainers to possess a degree or workforce credential of value by 2025\.7 While these high-level priorities do not explicitly single out AI, they create a strategic environment where AI education and research—as powerful drivers of workforce development, innovation, and economic competitiveness—become inherently relevant and strategically aligned. The skills developed through AI programs directly address the need for a technologically proficient workforce.

**B. University of Maine (Orono) Strategic Vision**

At the UMaine Orono campus, there is a more explicit strategic vision for AI, primarily driven by the UMaine AI Initiative. This initiative articulates a clear ambition: "To make Maine a world-class hub for artificial intelligence research, education, and applications".2 Its mission is to develop "transformative AI-based solutions that enhance the social and economic well-being of the citizens of Maine and beyond" through innovative research, education, and strategic partnerships.2 The UMaine AI Initiative is positioned as a "unique Maine-based venture that brings together university, industry, government, and community collaborators" 2, highlighting a commitment to broad engagement. This AI-specific vision is complemented by UMaine's wider institutional vision, influenced by frameworks like the "Blue Sky Project," which aspires for the university to be "distinctly student-centered and community-engaged," integrating teaching, inquiry, and outreach to benefit Maine's citizens and investing in signature programs characterized by interdisciplinary risk-taking.43 The annual Maine AI Conference, a key activity of the UMaine AI Initiative, serves as a platform to help Mainers adapt to the advancements in AI, discuss its responsible use, and apply it to solve real-world problems, thereby democratizing access to AI knowledge.1 The university's broader strategic re-envisioning, encapsulated in the motto "define tomorrow," further supports such forward-looking initiatives.54

**C. College-Specific Strategic Goals (e.g., College of Earth, Life, and Health Sciences \- ELH)**

College-level strategic plans translate the university's broader goals into actionable initiatives within academic units. The College of Natural Sciences, Forestry, and Agriculture (a precursor to parts of the current ELH) developed a "Roadmap to Excellence," which was built upon UMaine's "Blue Sky Project" and aimed to advance scientific inquiry and STEM education.43 Key initiatives in this roadmap included growing the research enterprise, enhancing the quality and impact of graduate education programs, fostering interdisciplinary risk-taking, and fulfilling the mission of serving the people of Maine.43 The current College of Earth, Life, and Health Sciences (ELH) aims to "power silo-busting innovation for a better world".38 One of its key thematic areas is to "Define Earth's future," which encompasses leading climate action, conserving the environment, and managing natural resources—all areas where AI can play a significant role.38 Research programs like the USDA-funded McIntire-Stennis projects (focused on forestry research) and Hatch projects (focused on agricultural research) are integral to ELH's research mission and often involve data-intensive work suitable for AI applications.38 These college-level plans create fertile ground for the integration and application of AI in addressing grand challenges related to environmental sustainability and health.

**D. Emphasis on Interdisciplinary Research and AI Workforce Development**

A consistent theme across UMaine's strategic thinking is the dual emphasis on fostering interdisciplinary research and developing an AI-proficient workforce. The UMaine AI Initiative actively promotes collaboration across academic disciplines and with external partners from industry and government.2 The Maine AI Conference is a prime example of bringing together diverse sectors to foster a shared understanding and collaborative approaches to AI.1 Academic programs, such as the Graduate Certificate in Data Science and Engineering, are explicitly designed to be accessible to students from varied fields, facilitating the spread of AI skills.10 The university's focus on AI's impact on Maine's workforce 1, coupled with the UMS's overarching priorities on meeting workforce needs 7, clearly underscores a strategic drive for AI workforce development. This dual focus is critical: interdisciplinary research is essential for solving complex, multifaceted problems with AI, while a skilled workforce is necessary to translate AI innovations into tangible economic and societal benefits.

UMaine's AI strategy is deeply interwoven with its land-grant mission and its profound commitment to serving the State of Maine, particularly its economy, environment, and workforce. AI is not pursued as an isolated academic discipline but rather as a powerful tool for regional advancement and problem-solving. This is evident in the UMaine AI Initiative's mission targeting the "social and economic well-being of the citizens of Maine" 2, the UMS strategic priorities driven by "Maine's workforce challenges" 7, and the focus of applied AI research on key Maine sectors like forestry, agriculture, and marine sciences.3

There is a clear institutional recognition that successful AI advancement requires a holistic ecosystem approach. This encompasses not only cutting-edge research but also comprehensive education at multiple levels (including undergraduate, graduate, certificates, and online programs for the existing workforce) 10, robust partnerships with industry and government, and active public discourse through conferences and webinars.1 This multi-faceted strategy aims to build not just AI technology, but also the human capital, collaborative networks, and societal understanding necessary for AI to thrive and be adopted effectively within Maine.

The strategic documents also reveal an agile and iterative planning process. For instance, the ELH Roadmap 43 explicitly builds upon past strategic plans like the "Blue Sky Project" while adapting to new opportunities and challenges, such as the rapid ascent of AI. The UMaine AI Initiative and the focus on AI in recent conferences 1 demonstrate a responsive approach to this evolving field, aligning with the UMS strategic priorities adopted in 2018\.7 This capacity to build on past successes while incorporating new strategic thrusts indicates institutional responsiveness and a commitment to long-term strategic evolution in the face of technological change.

## **Principled Innovation: Ethical AI and Responsible Research Conduct**

As the University of Maine expands its research and educational activities in Artificial Intelligence, it is concurrently developing and implementing frameworks to ensure that these endeavors are conducted ethically and responsibly. This commitment is evident through system-wide policies, campus-specific guidelines, and the integration of ethical considerations into research training.

**A. UMaine System and UMaine Specific "Research with AI Guidelines"**

A structured approach to AI ethics is being established at multiple levels:

* The **UMaine AI Initiative** plays a key role in disseminating guidance, making "Research with AI Guidelines" developed by the UMaine AI Steering Committee available to the university community.2  
* The **University of Maine System (UMS)** has promulgated "Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) – Guidance on Use," which is accessible to all UMS members via their maine.edu credentials.2 This comprehensive document addresses critical areas such as information security and privacy, intellectual property considerations, and acceptable use of AI tools.9  
* Individual campuses within the system are also proactive. For example, the **University of Maine at Augusta (UMA)** has developed resources like "Faculty Guiding Questions on Ethical Generative AI Use" and a "Students: Ethical Generative AI Use Checklist" to provide practical advice for navigating AI ethics in academic settings.8

These guidelines collectively provide a robust framework for the ethical and responsible engagement with AI technologies across research and educational activities, addressing potential issues proactively.

**B. Key Ethical Considerations Addressed**

The guidelines tackle several crucial ethical dimensions of AI use:

* **Information Security & Privacy:** A strong emphasis is placed on safeguarding institutional data and ensuring compliance with regulations such as the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). Faculty, staff, and students are explicitly warned against entering any Protected or Personal Information into Generative AI tools, as these tools may use input data for their own training, potentially exposing sensitive information.9 Specific guidance is also provided for maintaining participant privacy during meetings or video conferences where AI tools might be employed.9  
* **Intellectual Property:** The guidelines state that Generative AI may not be used in any manner that infringes on copyright or other intellectual property rights. Submitting copyrighted materials (text, images, video, or audio) into a Generative AI program could constitute a violation. Furthermore, because Generative AI may draw upon existing works, users are advised to confirm that any AI-generated content they quote or paraphrase does not plagiarize or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others.9  
* **Acceptable Use:** The UMS Acceptable Use Policy is applicable to the use of Generative AI. Prohibited activities include, but are not limited to, using Generative AI for unauthorized access, disruption of services, harassment, dissemination of obscene material, or the generation of malicious content such as malware or viruses.9  
* **Data Quality and Bias:** There is an acknowledgment that Generative AI tools produce outputs that are statistically probable rather than necessarily factual. This means that quotes, citations, and other data presented by AI may be fabricated or synthesized rather than drawn from actual sources.55 The Maine AI Conference also includes sessions focused on AI Data Quality and the importance of addressing potential biases that AI systems might inherit from their training data or user prompts.1  
* **Academic Integrity:** UMA's Academic Integrity Policy and the UMS Academic Integrity Statement are referenced in the context of AI use.8 Faculty are encouraged to clearly define the permissible uses of AI in their courses—ranging from required use to complete prohibition—and to establish expectations for citing or acknowledging the use of AI tools in student work.55

Addressing these specific ethical issues is paramount for maintaining trust, ensuring fairness, protecting individuals and the institution, and fostering a responsible AI ecosystem at UMaine.

**C. Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) Training**

UMaine ensures that its researchers are grounded in ethical research practices through mandatory training:

* All personnel involved in research with human subjects are required to complete the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) web-based training on the protection of human subjects. This training is valid for four years, after which refresher modules are necessary.56  
* The CITI RCR Basic course, widely adopted by research institutions, covers core norms, principles, regulations, and rules governing research practice. Topics include authorship, collaborative research, conflicts of interest, data management, mentoring, peer review, plagiarism, and research misconduct—all of which have relevance to AI research.57  
* The CITI Program also offers a specialized module on "Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Human Subject Protections".57 While it is not explicitly stated in the provided materials that UMaine mandates this specific AI module as part of its standard RCR requirements, its availability indicates a growing recognition of AI-specific ethical training needs.  
* Furthermore, the curriculum for the Graduate Certificate in Data Science and Engineering at UMaine includes a required 1-credit course, INT 601: Responsible Conduct of Research, ensuring that future data scientists are formally trained in ethical research practices.12

This multi-layered approach—combining system-wide policies, campus-specific guidelines, and integration into general RCR training—aims to embed ethical considerations at all levels of AI engagement within the University of Maine System. This comprehensive strategy ensures that ethical principles are not siloed but are reinforced through multiple channels, catering to different roles and contexts.

The guidelines demonstrate a pragmatic understanding of Generative AI's capabilities and limitations. For example, the potential for AI to generate fabricated information is explicitly acknowledged 55, as are risks related to data privacy and intellectual property infringement.9 However, rather than imposing outright prohibitions in all contexts, the approach often emphasizes user responsibility and the need for critical evaluation. Faculty are provided with a spectrum of options for how to incorporate (or restrict) AI in their courses, including using it to "generate ideas" or to "analyze AI" itself.55 This balanced perspective fosters AI literacy alongside ethical awareness, acknowledging AI's potential benefits while equipping users to navigate its inherent pitfalls.

The proactive development and dissemination of AI ethics guidelines, coupled with public discussions on these topics at events like the Maine AI Conference 1, suggest that UMaine aims to be a thought leader in the responsible adoption of AI, not just a technological innovator, particularly within its regional context. By addressing ethical concerns openly and providing clear guidance, UMaine is working to build trust and position itself as a responsible steward of AI technology. This can be crucial for fostering broader adoption and collaboration, especially with public and private sector partners in Maine who are increasingly concerned with the ethical implications of AI.
