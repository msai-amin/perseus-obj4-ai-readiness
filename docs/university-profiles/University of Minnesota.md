This report provides a detailed assessment of these components, illustrating UMN's position as a significant center for AI-driven environmental and natural resource science.

## **Academic Landscape:** 

**A. Overview of Relevant Colleges, Departments, and Programmatic Accreditations**

The University of Minnesota system, with the Twin Cities campus at its core, hosts several key academic units pivotal to the integration of AI with environmental and natural resource sciences. Prominent among these are the College of Food, Agricultural and Natural Resource Sciences (CFANS), the College of Science and Engineering (CSE), and the College of Biological Sciences (CBS).1 Additionally, the University of Minnesota Crookston (UMC) contributes relevant programs in natural resources.5 These colleges house the departments that confer degrees in foundational environmental disciplines and in the computational fields essential for AI development and application, such as computer science and statistics.

A hallmark of UMN's strength in traditional environmental disciplines is its long-standing programmatic accreditations. The Department of Forest Resources within CFANS offers Bachelor of Science (BS), Master's, and Doctorate programs in forestry that have been continuously accredited by the Society of American Foresters (SAF) since 1935\.7 This makes the Forest and Natural Resource Management (FNRM) major the sole four-year SAF-accredited program in Minnesota.9 Specific undergraduate tracks holding SAF accreditation include Forest Ecosystem Management and Conservation, and Urban and Community Forestry.8 Such accreditation is a critical external validation of program quality, ensuring adherence to rigorous professional standards in forestry education.

Similarly, within CSE, the Department of Civil, Environmental, and Geo- Engineering (CEGE) provides undergraduate degrees in Civil Engineering, Environmental Engineering, and Geoengineering that are accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET.10 ABET accreditation is the recognized standard for engineering and technology programs, signifying a high level of educational quality and preparation for professional practice in fields like environmental engineering, which are increasingly reliant on sophisticated computational tools and data analysis.

At the University of Minnesota Crookston, the Natural Resources program, situated within the Agriculture and Natural Resources Department, benefits from the campus's institutional accreditation by the Higher Learning Commission (HLC).6 The HLC also accredits all University of Minnesota campuses, including the Twin Cities campus, which has held this accreditation continuously since 1913 and is authorized to grant doctoral and professional degrees.13 While HLC accreditation is institutional rather than program-specific in these environmental fields, it ensures an overarching standard of quality for all academic offerings.

The presence of both broad institutional accreditation from the HLC and specialized programmatic accreditations from bodies like SAF and ABET points to a dual commitment at UMN: maintaining overall institutional quality while also pursuing excellence within specific professional disciplines. This combination is vital for attracting high-caliber students and faculty. It also ensures that graduates from programs like forestry and environmental engineering possess a knowledge base and skillset recognized by professional bodies, which increasingly value data literacy and computational competencies as prerequisites for addressing contemporary environmental challenges. This strong accredited foundation in domain-specific knowledge provides a robust platform upon which to integrate advanced AI methodologies.

Within the College of Biological Sciences (CBS), the Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior (EEB) hosts graduate programs where research spans from molecular levels to entire ecosystems.4 Faculty research in EEB includes developing mathematical theory for ecological phenomena (e.g., Allison Shaw) and employing quantitative genetics (e.g., Ruth Shaw).34 This strong theoretical and quantitative foundation in ecology and evolution makes EEB a prime area for AI/ML applications in understanding complex biological systems.

Specialized master's programs, such as the Master of Geographic Information Science (MGIS), offer advanced training in GIS theory, applications, and technology, serving as a critical pathway for students from diverse backgrounds, including environmental sciences, to gain deep geospatial expertise.36 Furthermore, the School of Statistics (College of Liberal Arts) and the School of Public Health provide core statistical and machine learning expertise through their MS and PhD programs in Statistics and Biostatistics, respectively.37 Courses such as PUBH 7475 (Statistical Learning and Data Mining) are directly relevant to AI.38 The Department of Computer Science & Engineering (CS\&E) is the primary source of advanced AI and Machine Learning coursework, offering a suite of graduate-level classes including CSCI 5512 (Artificial Intelligence II), CSCI 5521 (Introduction to Machine Learning), CSCI 5523 (Introduction to Data Mining), CSCI 5525 (Machine Learning \- graduate level), and CSCI 5527 (Deep Learning: Models, Computation, and Applications).40

The interdisciplinary structure of programs like NRSM, which encourages coursework and collaboration across departments 29, combined with specialized offerings in GIS, Statistics, and Computer Science, creates a rich ecosystem for graduate students. This environment allows them to merge deep domain expertise in environmental or natural resource sciences with sophisticated computational and AI skills, fostering innovation at these critical intersections. However, while domain-specific programs offer foundational computational courses 15, the most advanced AI/ML training resides within Computer Science 40 and Statistics/Biostatistics.37 The accessibility of these advanced courses for students from FNRM, ESPM, CEGE, ESCI, or EEB is a crucial determinant for the depth of AI integration into environmental research. Prerequisites for these courses, often demanding strong mathematical and programming backgrounds (as noted for CSCI 5525, which requires instructor permission for undergraduates 40), highlight the need for curriculum flexibility, potential bridging courses, or robust co-supervision arrangements to facilitate this cross-disciplinary engagement. The extent to which students from environmental disciplines can access and succeed in these specialized AI/ML courses will significantly shape the future of AI-driven environmental research at UMN.

**A. College of Food, Agricultural and Natural Resource Sciences (CFANS): Focus on Forestry, ESPM**

Within CFANS, the Department of Forest Resources harbors a significant number of faculty whose work directly involves geospatial analysis, modeling, and quantitative methods. Professor Chad Babcock specializes in Remote Sensing, Forest Inventory, Geospatial Analysis, and Bayesian Statistics.47 Dr. Irene De Pellegrin Llorente's research encompasses forest management planning, bioeconomy, spatially explicit forest planning, and uncertainty in such planning.47 Professor Adriana Uscanga focuses on Landscape Ecology, Remote Sensing & GIS, and Social-Ecological Systems 47, while Professor John Zobel's expertise lies in forest and natural resource biometrics, measurements, and modeling.47 Supporting these efforts are researchers and lecturers like Andrew Jenks (GIS), Leif Olmanson (remote sensing of water resources), and Alan Toczydlowski (GIS in wetland and forest soils).48 The Silva Lab, also in Forest Resources, investigates forest soils, tree growth patterns, and forest responses to environmental changes, inherently requiring data analysis and modeling.2 This collective expertise demonstrates a strong departmental emphasis on applying sophisticated analytical techniques to forest ecosystems.

The interdisciplinary Environmental Sciences, Policy and Management (ESPM) program draws upon faculty from various CFANS departments, creating a hub for quantitative environmental science. Faculty advising ESPM students include experts in soil science and GIS (e.g., Jay Bell), soil and water conservation modeling (e.g., David Mulla), climate science and modeling (e.g., Peter Snyder), and biometrics (e.g., John Zobel).49 While their primary appointments may be in departments like Forest Resources, Soil, Water, and Climate, or Fisheries, Wildlife and Conservation Biology, their involvement in ESPM facilitates cross-pollination of quantitative approaches to broad environmental problems.49

Broader CFANS initiatives also showcase direct AI applications. Dr. Ce Yang is leading a project to develop AI-enabled interactive learning tools for wildlife education, utilizing vision-language models and vision-question-answering techniques with iNaturalist datasets and Large Language Models (LLMs). His research also extends to analyzing carbon sequestration.51 Another notable effort is a Legislative-Citizen Commission on Minnesota Resources (LCCMR) funded project involving a UMN team (likely with CFANS participation) using AI and MMLLMs to analyze social media data for enhancing state park management, focusing on aspects like crowding and trail conditions.52

Collectively, the research landscape in CFANS reveals a robust foundation in geospatial technologies and biometrics, particularly within the Department of Forest Resources. This established strength is now visibly evolving towards the adoption of more advanced AI/ML techniques, as evidenced by specific projects leveraging LLMs and computer vision.51 CFANS, therefore, is well-equipped to lead in applying AI to forestry and natural resource management. The interdisciplinary nature of programs like ESPM further serves as a crucial nexus, bringing together diverse quantitative expertise from across the college to address multifaceted environmental challenges.

Professor Joshua Feinberg's work involves geophysical approaches and GIS, with applications in environment and climate.55 Professor Peter K. Kang holds the Gibson Chair of Hydrogeology, a critical area for environmental modeling.56 Assistant Professor Xinyuan Zheng, whose research area is Earth and Environmental Sciences, recently delivered a colloquium titled "Earth and Environmental Sciences in the Era of Big Data and AI," signaling the department's engagement with these advanced topics.56 ESCI's research portfolio includes Environmental Geoscience, Earth Surface Processes, and Computational Geoscience, with the Polar Geospatial Center serving as a vital resource for remote sensing and geospatial data analysis.21

The Department of Computer Science & Engineering (CS\&E) is the primary engine for AI/ML methods development at UMN and is a leader in applying these to environmental and agricultural challenges. Professors Shashi Shekhar and Vipin Kumar are spearheading the $20 million NSF/USDA AI-CLIMATE Institute. This flagship initiative is dedicated to advancing AI for agriculture and forestry, focusing on climate-smart practices, carbon sequestration estimation, and pioneering techniques like Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning (KGML) and spatial-variability-aware neural networks.59 CS\&E has a rich history, dating back to 1999, of developing machine learning methodologies for climate pattern discovery (e.g., El Niño) and environmental monitoring, such as deforestation detection.59 Furthermore, CS\&E faculty are involved in initiatives like the "AI for Earth Summer School," which aims to introduce students to the application of ML (including RNNs, CNNs, GNNs, and foundational models) for addressing environmental challenges in hydrology and agriculture using large Earth observation datasets.60

This distribution of expertise makes CSE uniquely capable of driving innovation. It not only houses core AI/ML and data science proficiency within CS\&E and the Data Science Initiative but also possesses substantial domain application strength in environmental fields through CEGE and ESCI. The AI-CLIMATE Institute serves as a prime example of this synergy, directly applying cutting-edge AI developed within CS\&E to real-world environmental problems.59 This strategic positioning allows CSE to develop novel AI methods specifically tailored for environmental complexities—such as KGML for data-scarce but knowledge-rich domains, and spatial-variability-aware neural networks for geographically nuanced predictions—and then rapidly deploy them through its environmental engineering and geosciences departments. Within CSE, hydrogeology and water resources modeling emerge as particular strengths, with dedicated faculty in both CEGE and ESCI employing computational modeling and remote sensing to address critical water-related environmental issues.53 This concentration of expertise is vital for advancing the understanding and management of water systems, an area where AI promises significant improvements.

**C. College of Biological Sciences (CBS): Ecological and Evolutionary Modeling**

The College of Biological Sciences (CBS), particularly its Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior (EEB), contributes crucial expertise in modeling complex biological systems, which is fundamental to conservation and environmental science. Faculty research within EEB inherently requires quantitative, modeling, and computational approaches. For example, Professor William Harcombe investigates microbial interactions, eco-evolutionary dynamics, and systems biology.34 Professor Forest Isbell's work on the drivers and consequences of biodiversity change likely involves sophisticated ecological modeling and data analysis.34 Professor Suzanne McGaugh examines genomic data to understand organismal adaptation, a field deeply rooted in computational biology.34 Professor Allison Shaw focuses on developing mathematical theory to understand organismal movement, a core component of ecological modeling.34 Professor Ruth Shaw employs quantitative genetics to study evolutionary processes in wild plant populations.34 Additionally, Professor Meggan Craft's research on infectious disease ecology involves modeling disease dynamics in animal populations.34 The department's broader mission is to increase understanding of biodiversity and its maintenance, contributing to sustainable living.25

The expertise within CBS/EEB in areas such as systems biology, quantitative genetics, genomic data analysis, and the mathematical modeling of ecological and evolutionary processes provides a strong foundation for leveraging AI and machine learning. These advanced computational tools can offer powerful new capabilities for analyzing complex biological patterns, recognizing subtle signals in large ecological datasets, and making predictions about biological responses to environmental change. Consequently, collaborations between EEB researchers and AI specialists, particularly those in CSE, hold the potential for significant breakthroughs. Such interdisciplinary efforts could greatly enhance the understanding and prediction of species and ecosystem responses to climate change, improve strategies for biodiversity management, and address pressing conservation challenges from a more integrated, systems-oriented perspective.

**D. Emerging Interdisciplinary Research Themes and Collaborations**

A defining characteristic of UMN's approach to AI in environmental sciences is the emphasis on interdisciplinary collaboration. The AI-CLIMATE Institute is a prime example, formally linking CSE (Computer Science) with CFANS (agriculture and forestry) to tackle climate change.59 Similarly, LCCMR-funded projects demonstrate practical collaborations, such as the AI-driven park management initiative involving a UMN team (likely CFANS) and the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) 52, and Dr. Ce Yang's (CFANS) AI wildlife education tool project, which plans engagement with UMN Extension.51 Individual faculty efforts also reflect this trend; Professor Joshua Feinberg (ESCI), for instance, collaborates across a wide array of disciplines including geosciences, anthropology, soil science, and biology.55

The "AI for Earth Summer School" further highlights this interdisciplinary drive, aiming to apply AI/ML to diverse environmental challenges using data from satellites, sensors, and physics-based models.60 The sentiment for increased cross-disciplinary work is also echoed in academic discourse, such as Assistant Professor Xinyuan Zheng's (ESCI) colloquium on "Earth and Environmental Sciences in the Era of Big Data and AI," which stressed the necessity of new collaborations, particularly with computer science and engineering.57

This pattern of cross-college and inter-departmental collaboration is fundamental to UMN's strategy for AI in environmental and natural resource sciences. The complex nature of the problems being addressed—climate change, biodiversity loss, sustainable resource management—inherently demands the integration of diverse expertise. The success of UMN in this rapidly evolving field will largely hinge on its capacity to nurture and sustain these interdisciplinary partnerships, effectively breaking down traditional academic silos between computational sciences and the environmental or natural resource disciplines. University-level structures like the Data Science and AI Hub 62 and the Institute on the Environment 63 are positioned to play pivotal roles in facilitating these crucial connections and fostering a collaborative research environment.

A particularly promising niche for UMN is its pioneering work in Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning (KGML), as highlighted by the AI-CLIMATE Institute.59 KGML methodologies, which integrate established scientific principles and domain knowledge directly into AI model architectures, are especially well-suited for scientific applications where empirical data may be limited or noisy, but a wealth of theoretical understanding exists. This approach can lead to more robust, interpretable, and generalizable AI models compared to purely data-driven techniques, which is a significant advantage when dealing with the complexities of ecological systems, climate dynamics, or natural resource management. The development and application of KGML could become a distinguishing feature of UMN's contribution to AI in the environmental sciences, allowing for more scientifically grounded and reliable AI solutions.

These include expert consulting, technical assistance for HPC hardware and software operation, and robust data storage solutions, encompassing both high-performance primary storage and cost-effective second-tier storage options.64 Additionally, MSI offers visualization resources, enabling researchers to interactively analyze and present large, complex datasets generated from simulations or AI models.64 The comprehensive nature of these resources and services positions MSI as a central enabling platform for computationally intensive environmental research. From large-scale climate simulations and hydrological modeling to the training of complex AI models for geospatial data analysis or ecological forecasting, MSI provides the necessary computational backbone. The capacity, accessibility, and support services offered by MSI are direct determinants of the ambition and scope of AI-driven environmental research that can be undertaken at the University.

**B. GPU Availability and AI/Machine Learning Software Ecosystem**

A critical component for modern AI research is access to Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), and MSI provides these specialized accelerators. The MSI service catalog indicates that one Service Unit (SU)—a metric used to track computational usage—is equivalent to 3.91 GPU-hours on an NVIDIA V100 GPU.64 The specific mention of V100 GPUs confirms the availability of hardware well-suited for demanding deep learning tasks and other AI/ML workloads commonly found in environmental applications, such as image analysis from remote sensing data or the modeling of intricate ecosystem dynamics.

While the primary service catalog does not explicitly enumerate the full suite of AI/ML software stacks (e.g., Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, R), MSI's provision of "support for the operation of high performance computing equipment and software" and "Consulting, Technical" services strongly implies that commonly used AI/ML development environments and libraries are supported.64 Furthermore, initiatives like the "AI for Earth Summer School" explicitly mention the use of Python and various machine learning libraries, which would necessitate their availability on UMN's computational systems.60 The availability of powerful V100 GPUs, coupled with anticipated support for standard AI software, ensures that researchers have the necessary tools to train and deploy sophisticated AI models, thereby enabling cutting-edge investigations into areas like computer vision for biodiversity monitoring or predictive modeling for climate change impacts.

**C. Access Policies and Support for Researchers and Students**

Access to MSI's HPC resources is primarily structured around UMN faculty, who serve as Principal Investigators (PIs), and their research groups, which can include postdoctoral researchers and students.64 Eligibility extends to faculty from other Minnesota post-secondary institutions and UMN Emeritus faculty. For educational purposes, faculty members can also request MSI accounts for students enrolled in specific courses they are teaching, provided the request is made in advance.64 New PIs receive a default storage allocation, with mechanisms in place to request additional capacity as research needs grow. Account management and annual renewals are handled through the myMSI online interface.64

All users of MSI facilities are required to comply with MSI's specific policies as well as the broader University of Minnesota "Acceptable Use of Information Technology Resources" policy.65 MSI maintains detailed data policies covering aspects such as data retention, protection of sensitive information, acceptable use of storage resources, and procedures for managing data when a PI departs from the institution.65 These policies are designed to ensure the responsible, secure, and equitable use of shared computational resources.

This access model, prioritizing faculty-led research groups, is typical for academic HPC centers. For students to effectively utilize MSI for AI in environmental research, they generally need to be integrated into a faculty member's ongoing research project or be enrolled in a course that has formally arranged for MSI access. This underscores the importance of faculty engagement in computational research as a conduit for student training in these advanced methods. While the "fair share" algorithm aims to provide equitable access 64, it also means that very large, computationally intensive student-led projects might encounter significant queue times unless they are part of a PI's prioritized research portfolio or if dedicated computational resources have been purchased.

## **Strategic Vision and Flagship Initiatives: UMN's Commitment to AI in Environmental Solutions**

**A. University and College-Level Strategic Priorities for AI and Data Science**

The University of Minnesota is demonstrating a clear and strategic commitment to advancing AI and data science, with explicit recognition of their importance for addressing environmental challenges. A significant institutional development is the evolution of the UMN Data Science Initiative (DSI) into the Data Science and AI Hub. This transformation signals a deliberate effort to integrate the foundational strengths of data science with the burgeoning capabilities of AI, aiming to position Minnesota as a leader in technological innovation and to cultivate an "AI MINDSET" across the university and state.62 The Hub's mission includes driving responsible innovation, fostering robust partnerships, and training a skilled, diverse workforce prepared for an AI-driven future.62

At the college level, the College of Science and Engineering (CSE) has been a key driver of this vision. The CSE Data Science Initiative (now integral to the university-wide Hub) has long aimed to achieve national and international prominence in data science research. Its goals include catalyzing interdisciplinary collaborations at the intersection of AI/data science and various science and engineering disciplines, with "Food, Energy and the Environment" explicitly named as one of its affiliate research areas.39 This directly links CSE's data science strategy to environmental applications. Further reinforcing this direction is the CS\&E 2030 Strategic Plan, which outlines goals to enhance the department's research mission, attract large-scale funding for interdisciplinary programs—including in areas like "sustainable computing"—and modernize its educational offerings to reflect the evolving technological landscape.66 "Sustainable computing" has direct relevance to environmental concerns and computational efficiency, while the emphasis on interdisciplinary programs creates pathways to bridge AI with environmental sciences more effectively.

While a specific, overarching AI-focused research strategic plan for the College of Food, Agricultural and Natural Resource Sciences (CFANS) was not detailed in the provided materials beyond its Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Strategic Plan 67, the college's general strategic direction, akin to other leading agricultural and natural resource science colleges (e.g., the example of University of Missouri's CAFNR strategic plan focusing on "Advancing Research and Innovation" through multidisciplinary collaborations to address major challenges 70), would inherently involve leveraging impactful research tools like AI. CFANS's active participation in initiatives like the AI-CLIMATE Institute further underscores its engagement with advanced computational approaches.

This top-down strategic emphasis on AI and data science, originating from university leadership and resonating within key colleges like CSE, creates a highly favorable environment for growth. The explicit inclusion of environmental relevance within these strategies, such as CSE's "Food, Energy and the Environment" research theme and CS\&E's focus on "sustainable computing," indicates a deliberate intention to apply these powerful computational tools to pressing global challenges. Such strategic backing is likely to translate into increased institutional resources, dedicated funding opportunities, and enhanced support for faculty and students working at the intersection of AI and environmental or natural resource sciences.

**B. Leading Research Centers and Institutes (AI-CLIMATE, Data Science and AI Hub, IonE, NRRI)**

The University of Minnesota's strategic commitment to AI in environmental solutions is embodied by several leading research centers and institutes that serve as nexuses for innovation and collaboration.

The **AI-CLIMATE Institute** stands as a flagship initiative, funded with $20 million from the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Institute of Food and Agriculture (USDA-NIFA).59 Led by CSE Professors Vipin Kumar and Shashi Shekhar, its mission is to revolutionize the agriculture and forestry industries by developing and leveraging novel AI methods. The institute focuses on promoting climate-smart practices, improving the estimation of carbon sequestration in terrestrial ecosystems, and providing advanced decision support tools for farmers and foresters. A key aspect of its research is the advancement of Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning (KGML) and spatial-variability-aware neural networks, designed to integrate scientific knowledge with data-driven AI.59

The **Data Science and AI Hub**, an evolution of the former Data Science Initiative (DSI), functions as the university's central coordinating body for data science and AI activities.62 It aims to integrate data science infrastructure with AI's advanced capabilities, fostering an "AI MINDSET" across Minnesota. The Hub is designed to drive responsible innovation, cultivate partnerships, and train a skilled workforce. As part of the broader Research Computing umbrella, which also oversees MSI and U-Spatial, the Hub plays a critical role in providing resources and fostering the interdisciplinary collaborations necessary for applying AI to diverse fields, including environmental science.63

**C. Notable Externally Funded Projects and Strategic Partnerships**

The University of Minnesota's commitment to AI in environmental sciences is significantly bolstered by substantial external funding and strategic partnerships. The **AI-CLIMATE Institute** itself is a testament to this, having secured a $20 million grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Institute of Food and Agriculture (USDA-NIFA).59 This five-year initiative builds upon previous successes, such as a $10 million NSF CISE Expeditions grant awarded in 2010, also co-led by Professors Kumar and Shekhar, which focused on understanding climate change and had recognized impacts in agriculture, environment, and forestry.59

Beyond this flagship institute, other externally funded projects highlight UMN's activity in this space. The Legislative-Citizen Commission on Minnesota Resources (LCCMR) has funded a project titled "Enhancing Visits and Environmental Management; Effective, Adaptive AI." This initiative aims to use AI and social media data to improve park management within Minnesota, demonstrating a direct application of AI to state-level conservation and recreation challenges.52 Another LCCMR-funded project, led by Dr. Ce Yang of CFANS, focuses on developing AI-powered interactive wildlife learning tools. This project also has aspirations for future funding through the USDA Conservation Innovation Grant program, indicating a strategy for sustained research and development.51

These major grants from federal agencies like NSF and USDA, as well as state-level bodies like LCCMR, serve as external validation of the quality, innovation, and relevance of UMN's research at the intersection of AI and environmental/natural resource sciences. Such funding not only provides the necessary financial resources for ambitious research endeavors but also significantly enhances the university's reputation, making it an attractive destination for talented researchers, students, and potential collaborators. Moreover, this pattern of funding suggests a strong alignment between UMN's research priorities and pressing national and state-level challenges in environmental stewardship and climate change adaptation. The AI-CLIMATE Institute also underscores the importance of internal and external partnerships, involving collaborations across UMN colleges (CSE, CFANS), research units (Minnesota Robotics Institute, Data Science Initiative, Office of the Vice President for Research), and with other academic institutions.59

## **Ethical Considerations and Responsible Innovation in AI Research**

**A. Frameworks and Training for AI Ethics**

The University of Minnesota is actively engaging with the complex ethical considerations arising from the increasing use of Artificial Intelligence in research. The university's Research & Innovation Office organizes an annual Research Ethics Week, and as part of this, the Consortium on Law and Values in Health, Environment & the Life Sciences sponsors a dedicated Research Ethics Day Conference.71 A recent conference in March 2025 specifically addressed "The Ethical Use of Artificial Intelligence in Research: Challenges & Emerging Guidance," indicating a timely focus on this rapidly evolving area.71

This conference tackled critical ethical dimensions pertinent to AI research, including issues of scientific integrity, appropriate authorship when AI tools are used, data privacy concerns (particularly with large datasets often used in AI), the potential for bias in AI models (especially those derived from training sets for Large Language Models \- LLMs), and broader questions of equity.71 Discussions also covered how trainees and students should be guided in the ethical use and acknowledgment of AI tools in their research, the complexities of obtaining informed consent for AI components in research protocols, and the role of Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) in providing effective oversight for research involving AI.71

This proactive engagement, exemplified by the dedicated AI ethics conference, demonstrates that UMN is not shying away from the ethical challenges posed by AI. However, the available information does not yet detail specific, codified university-wide policies or guidelines exclusively for AI ethics. This is particularly true for unique ethical considerations that might arise in the context of environmental or conservation research, such as the ethical deployment of AI in wildlife monitoring (e.g., privacy implications of widespread sensor networks), potential biases in environmental datasets that could lead to inequitable outcomes, or the transparency and interpretability of AI models used for critical environmental decision-making. While a robust framework for discussion and the development of guidance is clearly in place, researchers applying AI in environmental domains will likely need to navigate based on emerging best practices and general ethical principles. The formulation of domain-specific AI ethics guidelines, tailored to the nuances of environmental and natural resource science, could represent a valuable future direction for UMN to further solidify its commitment to responsible innovation.

**B. University-Wide Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) Requirements**

The University of Minnesota has established a comprehensive framework for Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) that applies to all individuals involved in research activities. UMN mandates that faculty, staff, and students participating in research projects complete RCR training.73 A specific requirement for new Principal Investigators (PIs) and postdoctoral fellows is the completion of the online CITI (Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative) RCR Core Training.73 Detailed instructions for enrolling in the CITI RCR Core training are provided by the university's Research Integrity and Compliance office.74

Recognizing the diverse funding landscape, UMN also addresses agency-specific RCR training requirements, including those stipulated by the National Science Foundation (NSF), the USDA's National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH).73 This is particularly relevant given that major AI-environmental initiatives like the AI-CLIMATE Institute are funded by NSF and USDA-NIFA, necessitating adherence to their specific RCR mandates.59

While the core RCR training is largely centralized, individual colleges and units also contribute to fostering an ethical research environment. For instance, CFANS offers an "Equity Certificate Hosted Online (ECHO)" program for its staff and faculty, adapted from the university's Office for Equity and Diversity (OED) certificate program. CFANS can also tailor workshops to meet the specific needs of its units, addressing broader aspects of inclusive excellence that intersect with responsible research practices.75 Within CSE, an example of RCR principles in practice can be seen at the Characterization Facility, where policies regarding co-authorship for facility staff are explicitly linked to Regents policy and covered in RCR training.76

This standardized, CITI-based RCR training ensures that all researchers at UMN are exposed to fundamental ethical principles, including data management, responsible authorship, conflict of interest, and research misconduct. This general ethical grounding is essential. However, the unique complexities introduced by AI—such as algorithmic bias, the opacity of some "black box" models, data privacy concerns with massive environmental datasets, and the intellectual property considerations of AI-generated outputs—require further specialized consideration. The university's AI ethics conference 71 represents a crucial step in bridging this gap, aiming to ensure that foundational RCR principles are thoughtfully and effectively applied to the evolving landscape of AI-driven research.

## **Conclusion**

The University of Minnesota has systematically developed a robust and multifaceted ecosystem for the application of Artificial Intelligence in environmental and natural resource sciences. This ecosystem is built upon several key pillars: strong, accredited academic programs in core environmental disciplines; a growing integration of foundational computational methods within these programs; dedicated faculty expertise spanning both domain-specific environmental sciences and cutting-edge AI methodologies; significant high-performance computing infrastructure; and clear strategic institutional initiatives aimed at fostering AI innovation.

Traditional strengths in forestry, environmental science, engineering, and ecology 7 are increasingly being augmented with essential computational skills such as GIS, statistics, and basic modeling at the undergraduate level.15 At the graduate level, specialized programs and research opportunities allow for deeper dives into advanced computational techniques. The primary loci of advanced AI and machine learning expertise reside within the Department of Computer Science & Engineering and the School of Statistics.37 A critical factor for UMN's continued success will be the seamless accessibility of this advanced AI coursework for students hailing from environmental science backgrounds, ensuring they can acquire the sophisticated skills needed to innovate. Flexible curricula, bridge programs, and interdisciplinary co-supervision will be vital in this regard.

Interdisciplinary research centers and institutes serve as powerful catalysts for innovation and collaboration. Flagship initiatives like the AI-CLIMATE Institute 59, which directly targets agricultural and forestry challenges with AI, and the overarching Data Science and AI Hub 62, which aims to create a vibrant AI ecosystem, are central to UMN's strategy. These are complemented by established centers like the Institute on the Environment (IonE) and the Natural Resources Research Institute (NRRI), which provide broad platforms for applying AI to sustainability and resource management issues.63 UMN's pioneering work in specialized AI approaches, such as Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning (KGML) highlighted by the AI-CLIMATE Institute 59, offers a potential niche that differentiates its research contributions, allowing for more scientifically grounded AI solutions in data-sparse environmental contexts.

Sustaining and expanding this capacity will require continued investment in computational infrastructure, particularly ensuring that resources at the Minnesota Supercomputing Institute (MSI) keep pace with the escalating demands of AI research.64 Equally important is the ongoing recruitment and retention of faculty with expertise in both AI methodologies and their innovative application to environmental and natural resource challenges.

The ethical dimension of AI is also receiving attention, with university-level discussions on AI ethics in research 71 and established Responsible Conduct of Research training programs.73 As AI applications in sensitive environmental contexts (e.g., conservation of endangered species, management of public lands, climate adaptation strategies) become more prevalent, UMN will need to continue developing clear, domain-relevant ethical guidelines and best practices.

Overall, the University of Minnesota is not merely exploring AI for environmental science but is strategically building a comprehensive capacity in this domain. It is moving from a phase of establishing foundational computational literacy within its environmental programs towards a more profound and systemic integration of advanced AI. The future trajectory will depend significantly on strengthening the collaborative bridges between domain science departments and core AI/data science units. Ensuring fluid pathways for students and researchers to acquire interdisciplinary skills and to engage in cross-cutting research will be paramount for UMN to solidify its position as a leader in leveraging artificial intelligence for a sustainable future.
