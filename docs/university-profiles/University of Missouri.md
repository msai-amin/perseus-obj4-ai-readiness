### **Academic Landscape: Natural Resource and Environmental Science Programs**

The foundation for integrating advanced computational methods into environmental and natural resource disciplines rests upon the strength and structure of the core academic programs in these areas. At the University of Missouri, the College of Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources (CAFNR), and specifically its School of Natural Resources (SNR), serves as the primary locus for such programs.

#### **Core Departments, Degrees, and Specializations (CAFNR, School of Natural Resources)**

The School of Natural Resources (SNR) within CAFNR is a comprehensive academic unit, described as one of the most extensive of its kind in the United States, offering a wide array of programs from undergraduate to doctoral levels.12 This integrated structure, housing diverse disciplines such as forestry, fisheries and wildlife, soil science, atmospheric science, and parks and recreation under a single administrative umbrella, inherently facilitates interdisciplinary collaboration and a holistic approach to natural resource management and environmental science. This is a significant structural asset when addressing complex environmental issues that often demand integrated data, diverse expertise, and sophisticated modeling approaches.

At the undergraduate level, SNR offers several key Bachelor of Science (BS) degrees. The **BS in Natural Resource Science and Management** provides students with emphasis area options in Forest Resources, Fisheries and Wildlife Sciences, Human Dimensions, and Terrestrial Ecosystems.18 The **BS in Environmental Sciences** allows students to specialize in Atmosphere, Land and Soil, Outreach and Education, or Water.20 Additionally, CAFNR offers a **BS in Agriculture** with an available option in Environmental Science.22 These programs are designed to equip students with foundational knowledge in their chosen fields, with curricula that increasingly incorporate quantitative and technological skills.

Graduate studies within SNR are consolidated under MS and PhD degrees in Natural Resources, offering a spectrum of emphasis areas that align closely with contemporary environmental and resource management challenges.17 Master of Science (MS) emphasis areas include Agroforestry (also available online), Fisheries & Wildlife Sciences, Forestry, Human Dimensions of Natural Resources, Parks, Recreation, Sport and Tourism, Soil, Environmental and Atmospheric Sciences, and Water Resources. Doctoral (PhD) emphasis areas mirror these, with the exception of Agroforestry and Parks, Recreation, Sport and Tourism not being explicitly listed as PhD tracks in the primary snippets detailing these degrees.23 The "Soil, Environmental and Atmospheric Sciences" graduate emphasis is particularly noteworthy, as these fields are inherently data-rich and computationally intensive, suggesting a potential concentration of faculty expertise and resources conducive to advanced modeling, remote sensing applications, and environmental informatics. Beyond SNR, CAFNR also houses programs in Plant Science & Technology and Agribusiness Management, along with various minors and certificates that may complement studies in natural resources and environmental science.13

#### **Accreditation Profile: Ensuring Quality and Professional Recognition**

Accreditation by recognized professional bodies serves as an external validation of program quality, curriculum relevance, and alignment with national standards, often enhancing graduate employability and professional standing.

A significant strength for MU's natural resource programs is the accreditation by the **Society of American Foresters (SAF)**. The Forest Resources emphasis area within the BS in Natural Resource Science and Management is accredited under the SAF Forestry standard, and the Terrestrial Ecosystems emphasis area is accredited under the SAF Natural Resources and Ecosystem Management standard.24 Notably, these are reported as the only SAF-accredited programs in the state of Missouri, a distinction that underscores MU's leadership in professional forestry education within the state.24 SAF accreditation is valuable as it verifies educational quality, facilitates professional entry through licensure and certification, and can enhance employment opportunities for graduates.25 The forestry profession is increasingly reliant on quantitative and geospatial skills, and SAF accreditation often encourages the incorporation of such competencies into the curriculum.

In contrast, information regarding specialized accreditation for the **BS in Environmental Sciences** program is not readily available within the provided documentation.20 While the program is listed as an offered degree within CAFNR 21, no direct evidence of accreditation by bodies such as the National Environmental Health Science and Protection Accreditation Council (EHAC) or ABET (for environmental engineering, a related but distinct field) for this specific MU Columbia program was found. Other institutions, like the University of Central Missouri (ABET for Occupational Safety \- Environmental Management) 29 and Missouri Southern State University (EHAC for Environmental Health and Safety) 30, are noted to have such accreditations for their respective programs, making the absence of similar information for MU's Environmental Science BS more apparent. While a lack of specialized accreditation does not inherently indicate lower program quality, it can be a factor for students considering professional careers where such credentials are valued. Given that MU seeks external validation for other SNR programs, such as the COAPRT accreditation for Parks, Recreation, Sport and Tourism 31, the status of the Environmental Sciences BS program in this regard warrants clarification.

**Table 1: Overview of Relevant Academic Programs and Accreditation at the University of Missouri**

#### **Curricular Integration of Computational and Quantitative Skills**

The effective application of AI, ML, and HPC in environmental and natural resource domains presupposes a foundational understanding of quantitative methods, statistics, and domain-specific computational tools like GIS and remote sensing.

**1\. Geospatial Technologies (GIS, Remote Sensing)**  
Geospatial technologies are fundamental tools in modern natural resource management and environmental science. Both the BS in Natural Resource Science and Management (NRSM) and the BS in Environmental Sciences require an introductory GIS course, either NAT\_R 2325 Introduction to Geographic Information Systems or GEOG 3040 Introduction to Geographic Information Systems GIS.19 This ensures a baseline competency in spatial data handling and analysis for all graduates in these core programs.  
The Environmental Sciences BS program further mandates ENV\_SC 4560 Observing the Earth from Space (a remote sensing course) or ABM 1200 Applied Computer Applications.20 The Land and Soil emphasis within this degree offers more advanced geospatial coursework as upper-level disciplinary electives, including GEOG 3830 Remote Sensing, GEOG 4940 Advanced Geographic Information Systems (GIS II), and NAT\_R 4385 Landscape Ecology and GIS Analysis I.32

At the graduate level, the MS in Natural Resources with a Forestry emphasis explicitly notes the availability of specialized education in GIS.33 Furthermore, several graduate courses within the interdisciplinary Graduate Certificate in Geographical Information Science (offered via the College of Arts & Science but with strong Natural Resources participation) directly involve advanced GIS, remote sensing, and modeling: NAT\_R 8325 Introduction to Geographic Information Systems, FOREST 7360 Forest Measurements (covering photogrammetry, inventory, and models), GEOG 7810/NAT\_R 7385 Landscape Ecology and GIS Analysis I, NAT\_R 8365 GIS Applications, and NAT\_R 8395 Landscape Ecology and GIS Analysis II.34 Soil Science graduate courses, such as SOIL 7360 Precision Agriculture Science and Technology (which integrates GIS, GPS, and remote sensing) and SOIL 9422 Pedology (mentioning GIS applications), also incorporate these technologies.37

The availability of both Undergraduate and Graduate GIS Certificates, requiring 15 credit hours and drawing courses from Geography, Natural Resources, and Engineering, provides structured pathways for students to gain specialized, recognized credentials in this area.34 These certificates include foundational courses like GEOG 3040/NATR 2325, and more advanced topics such as GEOG 4710 (Spatial Analysis), FOR 4360 (Photogrammetry, Inventory, Models), GEOG 4810/NATR 4385 (Landscape Ecology & GIS Analysis I), GEOG 3830 (Remote Sensing), GEOG 4940 (GIS II), and NATR 4365 (GIS Applications), with graduate-level counterparts at the 7000/8000 series.34 The Missouri Resource Assessment Partnership (MoRAP) further exemplifies the practical application of these skills, with expertise in UAV operation, satellite and aerial image analysis, hydrological modeling, land-cover classification (including object-based methods and machine learning), LiDAR applications, and suitability modeling.39

**2\. Statistical Analysis, Modeling, and Quantitative Methods**  
A strong grounding in statistics and quantitative reasoning is essential. The NRSM BS program requires MATH 1100 College Algebra and MATH 1400 Calculus for Social and Life Sciences I, along with a choice between ABM 2123 Quantitative Applications in Agricultural and Natural Resource Sciences or STAT 2500 Introduction to Probability and Statistics I.19 Crucially, all NRSM students must take NAT\_R 4110 Natural Resource Biometrics, a dedicated course in statistical methods applied to natural resources.19 Capstone courses like F\_W 4600W Ecosystem Management and F\_W 4650 Natural Resource Planning and Management also likely incorporate quantitative analysis and modeling principles.19  
Similarly, the Environmental Sciences BS program mandates MATH 1100/1160 and MATH 1400/1500 (Calculus), and either ABM 2123 or STAT 1200 Introductory Statistical Reasoning.20 The Land and Soil emphasis within Environmental Sciences provides access to upper-level electives such as NAT\_R 4110 Natural Resource Biometrics, F\_W 4500 Animal Population Dynamics and Management (which involves quantitative modeling), ENV\_SC 4320 Hydrologic and Water Quality Modeling, and GEOG 4710 Spatial Analysis in Geography.32 The general Environmental Sciences curriculum also lists "Hydrologic and Water Quality Modeling" (ENV\_SC 4320\) as a potential course.26

At the graduate level, while general statements affirm that MS and PhD programs in Natural Resources prepare students for research careers 23, specific quantitative and modeling coursework is typically embedded within the various emphasis areas.  
For instance:

* **Forestry:** FOREST 7360 Forest Measurements (inventory, models), FOREST 8490 Advanced Forest Management (quantitative methods for decision-making), FOREST 8515 Advanced Forest Biometrics (ecological modeling).41  
* **Fisheries & Wildlife Sciences:** F\_W 7500 Animal Population Dynamics and Management (quantitative modeling approach), F\_W 8530 Quantitative Ecology (methods to assess space use, abundance, population status; analysis of field and simulated data).42  
* **Soil, Environmental & Atmospheric Sciences (SEAS):** This area is rich in quantitative and modeling courses. Soil Science includes SOIL 7305/7306 Environmental Soil Physics & Lab (transport phenomena, measurement), SOIL 8400 Solute Transport in the Vadose Zone (development of flow equations, analytical/numerical solutions), SOIL 8500 Ecosystem Biogeochemistry (quantitative assessment of nutrient transfers), and SOIL 9422 Pedology (quantitative assessment of soil variability).37 Atmospheric Science offers ATM\_SC 7320 Atmospheric Dynamics (numerical modeling), ATM\_SC 7350 Mesoscale Meteorology and Dynamics (analysis techniques, modeling), ATM\_SC 7800 Numerical Methods in Atmospheric Science and Natural Resources, ATM\_SC 7980 Introduction to Atmospheric Simulations, ATM\_SC 8200 Meteorological Statistics, ATM\_SC 9300 Introduction to Chaos Theory, ATM\_SC 9350 Advanced Dynamic Meteorology, and ATM\_SC 9590 Advanced Applications of Weather Radar (quantitative uses of radar data).46  
* **Water Resources:** Relevant courses include NAT\_R 8290 Hydrologic Measurement and Synthesis (data analysis and synthesis using professional tools) and ENV\_SC 7320 Hydrologic and Water Quality Modeling (simulation models for watershed decision making).48  
* **General Natural Resources (Graduate):** NAT\_R 7110 Natural Resource Biometrics, NAT\_R 8024 Program Development and Evaluation in Informal Settings (designing, conducting, and analyzing quantitative educational research data), and NAT\_R 8510 Interdisciplinary Quantitative and Mixed Research Methods provide broader quantitative training.23

The presence of courses like SOIL 7360 Precision Agriculture Science and Technology, which explicitly combines GIS, GPS, and remote sensing 37, indicates a practical, applied integration of these technologies within a CAFNR context. This model of integrating multiple data streams and analytical techniques could be highly beneficial if expanded or mirrored in other natural resource domains like forestry or conservation.

**3\. Data Science, AI, and Machine Learning Foundations**  
While foundational GIS and statistics are integrated into undergraduate NRSM and Environmental Science programs, direct core requirements for advanced data science, AI, or ML courses appear limited. Students in these majors would typically need to pursue such advanced topics through electives, a minor, or potentially a dual degree. The BS in Data Science, offered through the College of Engineering or the College of Arts & Science, has a core curriculum including DATA\_SCI 1030 Foundations of Data Science, CMP\_SC 1300 Computing with Data in Python, CMP\_SC 2300 Introduction to Computational Data Visualization, and STAT 4510/4520 Applied Statistical Models I/II.52 The Computer Science focus of this degree further includes CMP\_SC 4540 Neural Models and Machine Learning and CMP\_SC 4750 Artificial Intelligence I.52 However, these are not explicitly cross-listed or required within the standard NRSM or Environmental Science curricula found in the provided documents.19  
At the graduate level, MU offers more direct pathways to AI/ML specialization. The MS in Data Science and Analytics includes emphasis areas such as High Performance Computing and Geospatial Analytics, and its curriculum incorporates tools like TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn, and SparkML.8 The College of Engineering provides a Graduate Certificate in AI and Machine Learning, with core courses like CMP\_SC 7720/ECE 7720 Introduction to Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition and CMP\_SC 8725/ECE 8725 Supervised Learning, and electives spanning AI foundations, data mining, and neural networks.14 Another option is the Graduate Certificate in Data Analytics Engineering, requiring CMP\_SC 8370 Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery.54 Foundational "boot camp" style courses in Python (DATA\_SCI 7002), R (DATA\_SCI 7004), and statistics for data analytics (DATA\_SCI 7005\) are also available, potentially serving as bridges for students from diverse backgrounds.9

The MU Institute for Data Science and Informatics (MUIDSI) hosts labs such as the "Bioinformatics, Data Mining and Machine Learning lab (BDM)" and the "Digital Biology Laboratory," which focus on applying ML, data mining, and deep learning to biological data, including plant and microbial systems.16 The expertise within MUIDSI, exemplified by faculty like Dr. Hatef Dastour, who specializes in applying remote sensing, geospatial analytics, big data analytics, and ML to environmental processes, climate change, water resources, and natural hazards (including forest fires, floods, and droughts), represents a direct and potent link between advanced computational science and the natural resource domains.57

**D. Specialized Pathways: Minors and Certificates in Data-Intensive Disciplines**

For students seeking more focused expertise, MU offers several minors and certificates that bridge natural sciences with computational disciplines. The interdisciplinary **GIS Certificates** (both undergraduate and graduate versions) are particularly relevant, requiring 15 credit hours and drawing coursework from Geography, Natural Resources, and Engineering.34 These certificates provide a structured curriculum in spatial data analysis, including courses like FOR 4360/7360 Photogrammetry, Inventory, and Models and NATR 4385/7385 Landscape Ecology and GIS Analysis I, making them an excellent pathway for CAFNR students to gain specialized geospatial skills.

The College of Engineering offers a **Data Science Minor** (18 credit hours) with core courses in data science foundations, Python programming, data visualization, and applied statistics.59 While potent, its accessibility for CAFNR undergraduates would depend on their ability to accommodate the prerequisite mathematics and computer science coursework.

At the graduate level, the College of Engineering also provides a **Graduate Certificate in AI and Machine Learning** (15 credit hours) and a **Graduate Certificate in Data Analytics Engineering** (12 credit hours).14 These certificates offer intensive training in advanced computational topics, including machine learning, data mining, big data analytics, and cloud computing. Their uptake by CAFNR graduate students would hinge on their prior quantitative and programming background or their willingness to undertake preparatory coursework. The MUIDSI-backed **Graduate Certificate in Geospatial Analytics** (12 credit hours) 9 further strengthens the offerings in spatial data science, likely leveraging expertise from across campus and aligning well with the needs of students in environmental and natural resource fields. These certificate programs represent significant opportunities for specialization, but careful academic advising is crucial to ensure CAFNR students can navigate any prerequisite hurdles and integrate these credentials effectively with their primary degree programs.

**IV. Advanced Computational Proficiencies: AI, ML, HPC, and Data Analytics Coursework**

Beyond foundational skills, the capacity for cutting-edge research and innovation in environmental and natural resource sciences increasingly depends on access to and proficiency in advanced computational disciplines. This section inventories relevant advanced courses at MU and analyzes their accessibility to students from CAFNR.

**A. Inventory of Advanced Courses (Computer Science, Engineering, Statistics, Data Science)**

The University of Missouri offers a range of advanced courses primarily through its College of Engineering (Departments of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science \- ECE/CS) and the Department of Statistics (College of Arts & Science), as well as interdisciplinary Data Science (DATA\_SCI) programs, that are pertinent to AI, ML, HPC, and data analytics.

* **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning:** A suite of courses provides in-depth training in AI and ML. Core offerings include CMP\_SC 7720 / ECE 7720 Introduction to Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition and CMP\_SC 8725 / ECE 8725 Supervised Learning.14 Further specialization is available through CMP\_SC 7750 Artificial Intelligence I 14, CMP\_SC 8750 Artificial Intelligence II, CMP\_SC 7770 / ECE 7870 Introduction to Computational Intelligence, CMP\_SC 8780 / ECE 8875 Advanced Topics in Computational Intelligence, CMP\_SC 8180 Machine Learning Methods for Biomedical Informatics, CMP\_SC 8735 / ECE 8735 Unsupervised Learning 14, and CMP\_SC 8770 / ECE 8890 Neural Networks.14 The BS in Data Science (Computer Science focus) also includes CMP\_SC 4540 Neural Models and Machine Learning.52 The Department of Statistics contributes with STAT 4520 / STAT 7520 Applied Statistical Models II, which incorporates neural networks and deep learning concepts.52  
* **Data Mining & Big Data:** Specialized courses in this area include CMP\_SC 8370 Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery 14 and CMP\_SC 7350 Big Data Analytics.54  
* **High-Performance Computing (HPC) & Parallel Programming:** A key course is CMP\_SC 4080 / ECE 4080 (cross-leveled as CMP\_SC 7080 / ECE 7080\) Parallel Programming for High Performance Computing.62 This course covers multi-process and multi-threaded programming, distributed architectures (clusters, grids, clouds), and GPU programming using CUDA and OpenCL. The MS in Data Science and Analytics with an HPC emphasis includes DATA\_SCI 8430 Parallel Computing for Data Analytics and DATA\_SCI 8420 Cloud Computing for Data Analytics.8  
* **Data Analytics & Visualization (Advanced):** The MS in Data Science and Analytics (HPC Emphasis) offers DATA\_SCI 8410 Data Mining and Information Retrieval.8 The Computer Science department lists CMP\_SC 8630 Data Visualization.54 Advanced statistical modeling is covered in STAT 4510 / STAT 7510 Applied Statistical Models I and STAT 4520 / STAT 7520 Applied Statistical Models II.52  
* **Other Relevant Advanced Courses:** For advanced remote sensing data processing, CMP\_SC 7650 / ECE 7655 Digital Image Processing 14 and CMP\_SC 8690 Computer Vision 14 are relevant. CMP\_SC 7740 Interdisciplinary Introduction to Natural Language Processing 14 could be applicable for analyzing textual environmental data or policy documents. Foundational programming and statistical skills for data science are supported by DATA\_SCI 7002 Python Programming Boot Camp 55, DATA\_SCI 7004 R Statistical Programming Boot Camp 55, and DATA\_SCI 7005 Introduction to Statistics for Data Analytics Boot Camp.9

**B. Accessibility for Natural Resource and Environmental Science Students: A Prerequisite Analysis**

A critical factor in leveraging these advanced computational courses for students in NRSM or Environmental Sciences is their accessibility, primarily determined by prerequisite requirements.

A significant "prerequisite barrier" appears to exist for undergraduate students from CAFNR wishing to enroll in many of these advanced AI/ML, HPC, and data analytics courses. For example:

* **CMP\_SC 7720 / ECE 7720 (Intro to ML):** Requires CMP\_SC 2050 Algorithm Design and Programming II and STAT 4710 Introductory Mathematical Statistics.62 Standard NRSM/EnvSci curricula include MATH 1100, MATH 1400, and an introductory applied statistics course like STAT 2500 or STAT 1200\.19 CMP\_SC 1050 Algorithm Design and Programming I is a prerequisite for CMP\_SC 2050\. STAT 4710 is a considerably more advanced, calculus-based statistics course than the applied statistics typically taken by CAFNR students. Thus, direct entry into CMP\_SC 7720 would necessitate substantial additional foundational coursework in both computer science and mathematical statistics, representing a significant deviation from their primary degree path.  
* **CMP\_SC 7750 (AI I):** Requires CMP\_SC 3050 Advanced Algorithm Design 62, which in turn requires CMP\_SC 2050\.62 This implies a sequence of CMP\_SC 1050 → CMP\_SC 2050 → CMP\_SC 3050, a core part of a CS major but not typically feasible for an NRSM/EnvSci student without a dual major or minor.  
* **CMP\_SC 4080 / ECE 4080 (Parallel Programming for HPC):** Prerequisites include CMP\_SC 3280 Computer Organization or ECE 3210 Microprocessor Engineering, AND CMP\_SC 3050 Advanced Algorithm Design or ECE 3220 Software Design in C/C++.62 These prerequisites demand a deep background in computer architecture and advanced algorithms, well beyond the scope of typical NRSM/EnvSci programs.

Courses like CMP\_SC 8725 (Supervised Learning) build upon these introductory ML courses, inheriting their accessibility challenges.62 Similarly, CMP\_SC 8370 (Data Mining) requires CMP\_SC 7380 (Database Management Systems I) 62, which itself has a sequence of CS prerequisites.62 Even foundational CS courses like CMP\_SC 1050, while requiring only College Algebra (which NRSM/EnvSci students take), are the entry point to a multi-course sequence not typically integrated into CAFNR degree plans.

Graduate students, particularly at the PhD level, may encounter greater flexibility. "Instructor consent" provisions, noted for several advanced courses 62, could allow students with strong quantitative backgrounds or relevant research needs to enroll after consultation. The DATA\_SCI "Boot Camp" courses (DATA\_SCI 7002, 7004, 7005\) 9 are explicitly designed to provide foundational programming (Python, R) and statistical skills for graduate students from diverse disciplines entering data science programs. These could serve as valuable bridging mechanisms, although their sufficiency as prerequisites for highly theoretical advanced CS courses is not guaranteed and would likely depend on the specific course and instructor.

Minors, such as the Data Science minor 59, and graduate certificates in AI/ML 14 or Data Analytics Engineering 54, offer structured pathways to acquire these advanced skills. However, they represent a considerable additional academic commitment (12-18 credit hours) on top of a primary degree in natural resources or environmental science. The feasibility of completing such a minor or certificate depends on factors like overall credit hour limits, course scheduling conflicts, and the proactivity of academic advising in guiding students through these interdisciplinary options. Some courses are cross-leveled (e.g., CMP\_SC 4080/7080 Parallel Programming for HPC 62), serving both advanced undergraduates and graduate students. While this can be an efficient way to offer specialized topics, it also implies that the rigor and assumed background knowledge might be pitched at a level that presumes strong foundational CS or Engineering preparation, potentially posing a challenge for students from other fields unless specific bridging support is provided.

Org.) or ECE 3210, AND CMP\_SC 3050 (Adv. Algo) or ECE 3220 62 | Very high barrier: Requires deep CS/ECE background in computer architecture and algorithms. |
| DATA\_SCI 7002 Python Programming Boot Camp | Data Science & Analytics | Python programming for data science, data manipulation libraries | Instructor consent recommended 55 | Accessible, especially for graduate students: Designed as a foundational course for diverse backgrounds. |
| DATA\_SCI 7005 Intro to Statistics for Data Analytics Boot Camp | Data Science & Analytics | Inferential and predictive statistics for data modeling and analytics | Instructor consent recommended 9 | Accessible, especially for graduate students: Builds upon basic stats knowledge. |
| STAT 4520 / 7520 Applied Statistical Models II | Statistics | Generalized linear models, mixed models, neural networks, deep learning | STAT 4510/7510 (Applied Stat Models I) 52 | Moderate to High barrier: Requires STAT 4510, which itself requires a solid statistics foundation beyond introductory level. |

#### **Faculty Research and Interdisciplinary Collaborations**

The successful integration of computational sciences into environmental and natural resource disciplines is heavily reliant on the expertise of faculty and the vibrancy of interdisciplinary research collaborations. MU exhibits strength in several key areas, with numerous researchers and centers working at this intersection.

**A. Leading Researchers in Computational Environmental Science and Natural Resource Management**

Several faculty members across various departments and centers at the University of Missouri are engaged in research that explicitly combines computational and quantitative methodologies with forestry, conservation, ecology, atmospheric science, and water resources.

Within the **School of Natural Resources (SNR)** in CAFNR, a significant cohort of researchers applies such methods:

* **Dr. Michael Stambaugh**, Director of the Center for Tree-Ring Science, focuses on forest ecology and fire ecology. His research extensively utilizes tree rings to investigate historical changes in forest ecosystems and involves fire effects modeling and paleoenvironmental reconstructions.65  
* **Dr. Benjamin Knapp** specializes in silviculture and restoration ecology, with research on tree regeneration and the application of prescribed burning. His work integrates ecological theory with practical silvicultural applications, including evaluating practices for establishing silvopasture.67  
* **Dr. Jeffrey Wood** investigates ecosystem-atmosphere interactions, particularly the fluxes of carbon, water, and nitrogen. As co-PI of the Missouri Ozark AmeriFlux (MOFLUX) site, he collaborates with remote sensing scientists and modelers to understand ecosystem responses to environmental changes like drought.69  
* **Dr. Alba Argerich** is a freshwater ecologist who employs experimental manipulations, observational studies, and **modeling** to understand human impacts on water quality and aquatic ecosystem functioning.

* **Dr. Baolin Deng** (Civil & Environmental Engineering), Co-Director of the Missouri Water Center, researches water treatment, contaminant transformation, and hazardous waste management. Such work often involves computational fluid dynamics and chemical process modeling, though not explicitly detailed as such in the snippets.91

Faculty within the **MU Institute for Data Science and Informatics (MUIDSI)** are pivotal:

* **Dr. Hatef Dastour**, an Assistant Teaching Professor at MUIDSI, specializes in geomatics, remote sensing, data fusion, geospatial analytics, big data analytics, and mathematical/statistical modeling. His research explicitly integrates advanced computational methods, including machine learning and agent-based modeling, to address challenges in environmental processes, climate change, water resources, and natural hazard management (e.g., forest fires, floods, droughts).57 This represents a very strong and direct linkage of advanced AI/ML with environmental and natural resource applications.

The presence of faculty with joint appointments (like Dr. Matisziw) and numerous documented collaborations (e.g., Dr. Stambaugh with federal agencies, Dr. Wood with modelers) underscores existing interdisciplinary connections. Figures like Dr. Dastour, whose expertise inherently bridges advanced computation with environmental science, are key catalysts for future growth. While traditional modeling, GIS, and statistical analysis are well-established strengths, the explicit application of cutting-edge AI/ML techniques to forestry, conservation, and broad ecological modeling appears to be an emerging area of emphasis, particularly highlighted by newer faculty and MUIDSI initiatives. Furthermore, the Extension roles of some faculty (e.g., Joseph Marschall) provide a crucial pathway for translating computational research findings into practical tools and knowledge for stakeholders across Missouri, fulfilling the university's land-grant mission.

### **Key Research Centers, Institutes, and Initiatives (MUIDSI, Missouri Water Center, MoRAP, Missouri Climate Center, Center for Tree Ring Science)**

The University of Missouri hosts several research centers and initiatives that are central to advancing computational approaches in environmental and natural resource sciences. These entities provide focal points for expertise, infrastructure, and collaborative projects.

The **School of Natural Resources (SNR)** itself is a hub for research in atmospheric sciences, soil sciences, fisheries and wildlife, and water quality, with broad focal areas including Environment and Society, Terrestrial Ecosystems, Water Resources, Climate Science, and Sustainability Science.12 Within or closely affiliated with SNR are several specialized centers:

* The **Center for Tree Ring Science (CTRS)**, directed by Dr. Michael Stambaugh, conducts multidisciplinary research using tree-ring data to study natural resources, climatology, archaeology, forest ecology, fire ecology, and quantitative wood anatomy.12  
* The **Missouri Climate Center (MCC)** provides atmospheric and climate science research, data, and extension services, particularly for Missouri's agriculture and natural resources sectors.12 Its work inherently involves climate data analysis and potentially modeling.  
* The **Missouri Water Center**, a collaborative entity merging CAFNR's Center for Watershed Management and Water Quality with the College of Engineering's Missouri Water Resources Research Center, aims to coordinate leading-edge water research. Its goals include developing new technologies for monitoring and predictive modeling of water resources, advancing treatment technologies, and supporting economic modeling for water resource management.95 The **Aquatic Ecology Laboratory** within SNR, associated with Dr. Argerich, employs observational, experimental, and modeling approaches to study urban stream ecology, terrestrial-aquatic interfaces, and the effects of forestry practices on water quality.74  
* The **Missouri Resource Assessment Partnership (MoRAP)** is a critical unit for geospatial data development and analysis. MoRAP specializes in UAV applications, remote sensing, image analysis, natural resource planning, hydrological modeling, vegetation mapping, climate data analysis, land-cover classification (including object-based methods and **machine learning**), LiDAR applications, terrain/landscape modeling, and suitability analysis.39 Their projects demonstrate practical applications of these advanced computational techniques, such as using machine learning for riparian and wetland mapping and developing suitability models for urban tree planting.40  
* The **MOFLUX** research site, a Department of Energy-funded collaboration, measures the carbon and water balance of Missouri's oak-hickory forests using a tall tower, contributing to a larger network of "AmeriFlux" sites and providing crucial long-term data for ecosystem modeling.12  
* The **Quantitative Silviculture Laboratory** within SNR focuses on developing quantitative tools, publications, and courses to improve silviculture and forest management.93

The **MU Institute for Data Science and Informatics (MUIDSI)** stands as a university-wide catalyst for AI and data science research and education. While many of its labs focus on biomedical applications, labs like the "Bioinformatics, Data Mining and Machine Learning lab (BDM)" and the "Digital Biology Laboratory" develop ML, data mining, and deep learning methods for analyzing biological data, including that from plants and microbes, which has relevance to environmental science.16 MUIDSI's 5-year plan includes "Data-Driven Agriculture" as a key research thrust 96, and its affiliated faculty, such as Dr. Hatef Dastour (geospatial AI/ML for environmental applications) and Dr. Timothy Matisziw (geospatial intelligence), provide direct links to environmental and natural resource domains.57 MUIDSI also offers an MS in Data Science and Analytics with relevant emphasis areas like Geospatial Analytics and High Performance Computing.9

The **Johnny Morris Institute of Fisheries, Wetlands and Aquatic Systems (FWAS)** also contributes, with affiliate faculty like Dr. Alba Argerich who utilizes modeling in her freshwater ecology research.12

These centers and initiatives demonstrate a strong existing foundation in geospatial analysis, environmental modeling, and quantitative natural resource assessment. MoRAP's explicit use of machine learning in projects is particularly noteworthy. MUIDSI is well-positioned to act as an interdisciplinary hub, connecting its core AI/data science expertise with the domain-specific challenges and rich datasets generated by SNR researchers and environmental monitoring programs like MOFLUX and the Lakes of Missouri Volunteer Program. These long-term data collection efforts are invaluable assets for developing and validating sophisticated computational models and AI/ML applications. While individual centers exhibit strong computational links, a key area for future growth lies in enhancing systematic collaboration and resource sharing between these specialized environmental/NR centers and the broader AI/data science initiatives at MU, ensuring a coordinated strategy to apply MUIDSI's AI expertise to MoRAP's geospatial data or SNR's ecological datasets, for example.

#### **Flagship Externally Funded Projects (NSF, USDA)** 

The University of Missouri has secured several significant externally funded projects that underscore its capabilities at the intersection of computational sciences and disciplines relevant to environmental and natural resource management. These grants often serve as indicators of national recognition and foster interdisciplinary collaboration.

* A prominent example is the **NSF Convergence Accelerator Track on Food & Nutrition Security**, where MU leads the **SENS-D project**. This initiative focuses on developing a sensor-enabled decision support system to build resilient food systems, leveraging rapid pathogen sensors and providing data-driven solutions through visualization, prediction, and optimization capabilities.3 While primarily targeting food safety, the project's methodologies—involving sensors, data analytics, predictive modeling, and decision support—are highly transferable to environmental monitoring, conservation technology, and natural resource management.  
* MU received a five-year, $3 million grant from the **National Science Foundation (NSF) Research Traineeship (NRT) program** to establish a doctoral training program aimed at preparing the next generation of scientists and engineers in the emerging fields of materials science and data science and analytics.99 This program enhances the university's overall capacity to produce graduates skilled in data science, which can benefit all research domains, including environmental sciences.  
* A $2.4 million grant from the **U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)** supports research to upscale bioplastic production from food waste, aiming to replace petroleum-based plastics.99 This project has direct environmental benefits related to waste reduction and sustainable materials.  
* Mizzou Engineers are involved in a partnership, supported by a $1.87 million grant (via Arizona State University), to utilize **AI and ML for modeling and testing new materials**.99 While the primary application mentioned is not environmental, the development of AI/ML methodologies for materials science can lead to innovations in environmentally friendly materials or materials for environmental remediation.  
* Individual faculty members in SNR also have strong records of external funding. Dr. Michael Stambaugh's forestry research has garnered over $8 million in grants since 2010, with collaborations involving the U.S. Forest Service, U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, and the National Park Service.65 Dr. Timothy Matisziw's work in geospatial modeling and GIS has received funding from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), directly linking his computational expertise to environmental applications.89  
* The MOFLUX research site is funded by the Department of Energy 93, supporting long-term ecological data collection vital for climate and ecosystem modeling.  
* MUIDSI's Bioinformatics, Data Mining and Machine Learning lab (BDM) reports funding from both NIH and NSF for its work, which includes analysis of plant and microbial data.16

These funded projects demonstrate MU's capacity to compete for and win major federal grants in areas involving data science, AI/ML, sensor technology, and modeling. Many of these initiatives are inherently interdisciplinary, fostering collaboration between data scientists and domain experts, and are often use-inspired, aiming to develop practical solutions to societal challenges. This aligns well with MU's land-grant mission. While there is clear evidence of data-intensive environmental research securing funding, there appears to be an opportunity to pursue more flagship-level grants that explicitly center on the application of AI/ML to core forestry, conservation, or broad ecosystem modeling challenges with the same prominence as the SENS-D project in food systems or the NRT in materials/data science. Such initiatives could further solidify MU's leadership in the computational environmental sciences.

### **Research Computing Infrastructure and Resources**

The capacity to conduct cutting-edge computational research in environmental science and natural resources is critically dependent on access to robust research computing infrastructure, including High-Performance Computing (HPC) clusters, Graphical Processing Units (GPUs), and a comprehensive suite of AI/ML software.

#### **High-Performance Computing (HPC) Capabilities (Clusters, GPU Resources)**

The University of Missouri, through its IT Research Support Solutions (ITRSS) team, actively supports and develops next-generation computing resources. ITRSS plays an integral role in the MizzouForward initiative, enhancing MU's research and education missions by providing access to HPC, GPUs, and Research Data Ecosystem Storage (RDE).100

Key HPC resources available to MU researchers include:

* **Hellbender Cluster:** Launched in 2023, Hellbender is a traditional HPC research cluster primarily funded by MU's Division of Research, Innovation & Impact (DRII) to accelerate MizzouForward initiatives.10  
  * *CPU Nodes:* Initially comprised 112 compute nodes, each equipped with two AMD 7713 processors and 512GB of RAM.10  
  * *GPU Nodes:* Features 17 powerful GPU nodes, each containing four Nvidia A100 80GB RAM GPUs, two Intel Xeon 6338 processors, and 256GB of system RAM.10 This configuration is particularly well-suited for demanding AI/ML and deep learning workloads.  
* **The Foundry Cluster:** This cluster consists of 160 compute nodes (each with two AMD Epyc 7502 processors and 256GB of RAM) and 6 GPU nodes.10  
  * *GPU Nodes:* Each Foundry GPU node is equipped with four Nvidia V100 GPUs with 32GB of GPU RAM each, two Intel Xeon 6248 processors, and 192GB of system RAM.10 While the V100 is an older generation than the A100, these nodes still offer substantial GPU computing power.  
* **Nautilus (Contribution to National Research Platform):** MU makes a significant contribution to the NSF-funded National Research Platform's (NRP) Nautilus hyper-converged distributed cluster by providing six advanced multi-GPU AI accelerator nodes.9 These nodes contribute over 1TB of GPU memory through 24 Nvidia A100 GPUs, alongside 5TB of CPU RAM and 1280 CPU cores.9 Critically, MU also hosts the first publicly available Grace Hopper AI Superchip (GH200) on Nautilus, representing access to leading-edge AI-focused hardware.9  
* **General MU Research Computing Environment:** The broader MU research computing services offer a heterogeneous environment with over 5200 cores and 52 TB of RAM. This is supported by 700 TB of dedicated research data storage (Isilon) and 1 PB of General Purpose Research Storage (Isilon), accessible both on the cluster and across campus. The cluster is connected to the Internet2 AL2S SDN network at a high bandwidth of 100 Gigabits.101  
* **Physical Infrastructure Considerations:** The HPC datacenter includes GPU racks capable of hosting up to 7 GPU nodes. However, these high-density GPU configurations can exceed the designed air-cooling capacity of the racks (5,500 W), highlighting a potential infrastructure challenge due to the high power demands of GPUs.102 This may impact future scalability or require further investment in cooling solutions.

This substantial and modern HPC infrastructure, particularly the recent addition of the Hellbender cluster with its A100 GPUs and the contribution to the national Nautilus platform (including the Grace Hopper Superchip), signals a strong institutional commitment to providing researchers with state-of-the-art computational tools essential for data-intensive science and AI/ML research.

**AI/ML Software Ecosystem (TensorFlow, PyTorch, R, Python libraries)**

A robust hardware infrastructure must be complemented by a comprehensive software ecosystem. MU's HPC resources support a wide array of software relevant to AI/ML and data science:

* **Operating System and Core Environment:** Clusters like Hellbender and The Foundry typically run OpenHPC on a CentOS Linux base.10  
* **Standard Scientific Libraries and Tools:** Commonly available software includes MPI implementations (MPICH, OpenMPI) for parallel computing, the R statistical computing environment, the SLURM job queuing manager for resource allocation, database utilities (MySQL), numerical libraries (BLAS, LAPACK), scripting languages (Perl, Python), scientific Python libraries (SciPy, MatPlotLib), and support for HDF4/5 data formats.10  
* **AI/ML Frameworks and Libraries:** The MUIDSI Data Science and Analytics program's infrastructure explicitly supports cutting-edge machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn, and SparkML, along with cloud computing libraries like boto3.9 Given that GPU nodes are reported to handle over 90% of ML workloads, support for CUDA (for Nvidia GPUs) and associated deep learning libraries like PyTorch is also indicated.102  
* **Containerization:** Limited support for Singularity containers is provided.10 This is crucial for researchers needing to deploy complex, customized software environments or ensure reproducibility of their computational workflows, common requirements in AI/ML research.  
* **User Interaction:** The MUIDSI DSA program facilitates interaction with these technologies via a customized JupyterHub environment, allowing students and researchers to conduct hands-on learning using Jupyter Notebooks.9

This software stack, combined with the policy of installing additional open-source software upon request and a defined procurement process for licensed software 10, ensures that researchers have access to the tools necessary for a broad range of computational tasks, from traditional modeling to advanced AI/ML development.

#### **Access Frameworks for University Researchers and Students (with attention to CAFNR)**

Accessibility to these powerful resources is key for their widespread utilization. MU has established access policies for its HPC clusters:

* **Hellbender Cluster:** Offers two tiers of access for University of Missouri researchers.10  
  * *General Access:* This tier is free and available to all UM researchers. It provides an equal share of at least 50% of the cluster's resources.  
  * *Priority Access:* This tier provides dedicated access to a specified number of nodes and is available through investment (e.g., faculty or departmental buy-in).  
  * Access is requested via an online form.10  
* **The Foundry Cluster:** Similar access policies apply. General access for UM system researchers is typically granted upon request to the IT help desk, while priority access to dedicated hardware can be obtained through investment.10  
* **Software Access:** Open-source software is generally installed cluster-wide. Licensed software installation is managed by ITRSS, and while ITRSS may facilitate cost-sharing or cover costs for widely used software, users are typically responsible for funding fee-based licenses.10  
* **Support and Assistance:** ITRSS offers grant proposal assistance for IT-related projects and specialized system support for research computers.100 This support can be valuable for CAFNR faculty seeking to incorporate HPC or AI/ML components into their research grant applications.

The provision of free general access to state-of-the-art HPC resources like Hellbender is a significant enabler for broad research participation. This policy lowers the barrier to entry for CAFNR faculty and students who may be new to HPC or AI/ML methods or whose research may not traditionally command large computational budgets. However, while general access policies are clear, the extent of tailored HPC/AI support, specialized training programs, or dedicated liaison personnel specifically for CAFNR researchers is not detailed in the provided information. The effectiveness of ITRSS support for domain scientists in CAFNR would depend on proactive outreach, the availability of domain-specific assistance, and training workshops contextualized for natural resource and environmental science applications.

**Table 5: University of Missouri High-Performance Computing (HPC) Resources for Research**

**VII. Strategic Imperatives: Aligning Institutional Vision with Computational Advancement in Environmental Domains**

The University of Missouri's strategic direction, at both the institutional and college levels, reflects an increasing recognition of the importance of AI, data science, and computational research, with notable implications for environmental and natural resource programs.

### **University and College Strategic Priorities for AI, Data Science, and Computational Research**

The **University of Missouri Strategic Plan (2024-2030)** sets a clear course to "Elevate High-Impact Research, Scholarship & Creative Works".11 A cornerstone of this vision is **MizzouForward**, a decade-long, $1.5 billion investment targeting student success, research productivity, and infrastructure improvements.11 This substantial investment directly supports the enhancement of computational resources, as seen with the Hellbender HPC cluster.10 Critically, the university's plan explicitly states a commitment to "tackling local and global challenges presented by rising concerns over energy and sustainability and rapid growth in artificial intelligence".11 This positions AI and sustainability as interconnected strategic priorities, creating a favorable environment for initiatives that apply computational methods to environmental issues. The establishment of the Cyber Education, Research and Infrastructure Center further signals this commitment.11 Additionally, a planned $2 billion comprehensive campaign, set to launch in 2025, includes "Build a Sustainable World" as a key philanthropic theme, potentially channeling further resources into these areas.11

The **College of Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources (CAFNR) Strategic Plan (2019-2025)** outlines several priorities and "Grand Ideas" that align with computational advancement in its domains.103 Among its six strategic priorities, "Advancing Research and Innovation" and "Empowering Missourians" are particularly relevant. A key "Grand Idea" is **"Smart Farms, Smart Agriculture: The Digital Age of Farming."** This initiative explicitly details the role of technologies like robotics, AI, GPS, embedded sensors, and big data analytics in enhancing agricultural efficiency, improving product quality, and benefiting the environment. CAFNR aims to develop new sensors and data processing technologies, create user-friendly decision management tools, and offer educational programs on leveraging AI and data analytics for cost reduction and environmental stewardship.103 This provides a strong internal directive for CAFNR to integrate AI and data science, especially at the agriculture-environment nexus. Another Grand Idea, **"Healthy Ecosystems for Life on the Planet (HELP),"** calls for a coordinated campus-wide effort to study the interrelationships between plants, animals, ecosystems, the environment, and humans from a holistic health perspective.103 Such a broad and complex undertaking inherently necessitates advanced data synthesis, modeling, and computational analysis.

The **College of Engineering** is also actively advancing in these areas. It is launching a new Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program focused on AI and prescriptive analytics, partnering on big data processing for NextGen Precision Health, and has introduced a Graduate Certificate in Data Analytics Engineering to meet industry demand.15 Research efforts include using AI for materials discovery.99

The **MU Institute for Data Science and Informatics (MUIDSI)** plays a crucial role, with a 5-year plan that includes "Data-Driven Agriculture" as a research area and collaborations like the Quantum Innovation Center (QIC) with IBM, which is intended to support interdisciplinary research in fields including geospatial analytics and plant genomics.96

#### **Envisioned Impacts on Forestry, Conservation, and Environmental Science Programs**

These strategic priorities are poised to significantly impact forestry, conservation, and environmental science programs at MU. CAFNR's "Smart Farms, Smart Agriculture" initiative, with its focus on using AI and data analytics to "help the environment," has direct implications for agricultural environmental science and sustainable land management practices.103 The tools and methodologies developed for smart agriculture—such as sensor networks, predictive analytics for resource use, and AI-driven decision support—are highly transferable to precision forestry (e.g., optimizing timber harvesting, monitoring forest health), conservation (e.g., habitat modeling, wildlife tracking, anti-poaching efforts), and broader environmental monitoring.

The "Healthy Ecosystems for Life on the Planet (HELP)" Grand Idea, by its very nature, will drive demand for advanced computational tools to understand and model complex ecological interactions, thereby impacting research in conservation biology, ecosystem science, and environmental management.103 The university-wide strategic emphasis on both AI and sustainability 11 is likely to encourage and prioritize research proposals and curriculum development that bridge these two domains, benefiting programs in forestry, conservation, and environmental science that adopt computational approaches.

MUIDSI's focus on "Data-Driven Agriculture" and the QIC's application to geospatial analytics and plant genomics 96 can provide enabling technologies and expertise for natural resource management, including areas like forest genetics, conservation genomics, and advanced spatial modeling for habitat suitability or climate change impact assessment. The 2021 Combined Research and Extension Annual Report highlights "environmental and natural resources" and "sustainable agriculture" as key focuses, explicitly mentioning GIS/GPS applications, watershed management, forestry health, and the goal of helping farmers implement "climate-smart management practices".104 This points to an institutional drive to apply data-driven technologies to tangible, on-the-ground natural resource and environmental challenges.

The MizzouForward initiative 11, by funding infrastructure (like the Hellbender HPC cluster 10) and supporting research productivity, serves as a critical financial and strategic enabler for these advancements. It provides the means to acquire necessary computational resources and to support faculty hires in these interdisciplinary fields. While the strategic plans for agriculture are quite explicit in their embrace of AI and data science, the impact on forestry and conservation programs, though significant, is often more implicit. There is a clear opportunity to articulate more directly how these advanced computational tools will be leveraged to address specific challenges in sustainable forestry, biodiversity conservation, and ecosystem management beyond the agricultural context.

### **Governance and Integrity in the Age of AI and Big Data**

The increasing integration of AI and data-intensive methodologies into research and education necessitates robust frameworks for ethical conduct, academic integrity, and responsible innovation. The University of Missouri has begun to establish such structures.

#### **Frameworks for AI Ethics and Responsible Innovation**

MU is demonstrating a proactive approach to navigating the complexities of AI. A key development is the update to the **University Academic Honesty Policy** in October 2024, which now incorporates language specifically addressing the use of AI.105 This policy permits the use of generative AI tools for specific assignments if allowed by the instructor, but stipulates that AI-created work should not exceed 25% of the submitted material and requires clear identification of AI-generated portions. Importantly, it holds students fully responsible for the accuracy and integrity of information submitted based on AI queries, ensuring adherence to academic honesty standards, intellectual property laws, and protocols for non-public research.105

To guide the institution's engagement with AI, a university-wide **AI Advisory Panel** has been established.105 This panel is charged with overseeing the exploration, adoption, and governance of AI tools and technologies across academic and administrative functions. Its responsibilities include assessing AI's impact on teaching, learning, and research, and providing recommendations for responsible and ethical use. The panel's mandate covers policy guidance (ensuring compliance with legal, ethical, and accreditation standards), educational initiatives (promoting awareness, academic integrity, and critical thinking regarding AI), addressing ethical considerations (such as bias, privacy, transparency, and fairness), conducting impact assessments, and engaging with external organizations to stay abreast of AI advancements and best practices.105 The panel reports to the Provost's Office and can form subgroups to tackle specific issues like AI ethics, curriculum development, or data privacy.

Further evidence of MU's commitment to fostering ethical AI practices is the **AI Workshop Series**, which includes sessions like "AI Ethics, Privacy, and Compliance" for faculty and staff, co-facilitated by an AI Fellow and the Director of Enterprise Architecture.106 Such initiatives are crucial for building awareness and capacity within the university community. General cautions regarding AI use, such as acknowledging potential biases and inaccuracies, exercising caution with data privacy, recognizing AI's limitations in true comprehension, and adhering to specific class policies, are also being disseminated.105 These local efforts align with broader academic discussions on AI ethics in research, which emphasize author accountability, transparency, and the irreplaceable role of human critical thinking and ethical judgment.7

#### **Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) Training and Data Management Principles**

The University of Missouri mandates training in the Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) for its personnel, particularly those involved in federally funded projects. MU subscribes to the **Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) Program** for its RCR training.108 This training is a requirement for researchers receiving funding from major agencies like the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the National Science Foundation (NSF), and the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA).109

The CITI RCR modules are accessible via Single Sign-On (SSO) and cover various academic disciplines, including Biomedical Research, Social and Behavioral Sciences, Humanities, Engineering, and Physical Sciences.108 Participants must complete an Integrity Assurance Statement and achieve a passing score on module quizzes (either 80% on all quizzes 108 or an average of 75% 109 is mentioned). The training typically takes about two hours to complete and importantly, this RCR training is distinct from and does not fulfill the requirements for Institutional Review Board (IRB) training related to human subjects research.108

Regarding data management, while the snippets do not detail a specific, overarching MU policy for research data management, particularly for large computational datasets in environmental sciences, general principles are likely covered within the CITI RCR training. Standard RCR curricula typically address data acquisition, management, sharing, and ownership. The existence of "Research Data Ecosystem Storage (RDE) resources" under ITRSS 100 and substantial Isilon storage capacity 101 indicates that infrastructure to support data management is in place. Furthermore, researchers are expected to comply with agency-specific data sharing and management plans (e.g., from NSF, NIH, DOE) when applicable.110

While the CITI program offers discipline-specific RCR tracks like "Physical Sciences" or "Engineering," the provided information does not explicitly confirm whether these modules at MU delve deeply into the nuanced ethical issues unique to big data management in environmental contexts, algorithmic bias in environmental modeling, or the responsible use of AI in conservation (e.g., privacy implications of AI-driven surveillance for wildlife monitoring).53 The AI Advisory Panel's broad charge includes considering such ethical implications 105, but the direct translation of these considerations into specific, readily available training modules for researchers in environmental and natural resource fields is an area that may require further development or clarification. The ongoing AI Workshop Series 106 and the educational mandate of the AI Advisory Panel suggest that AI ethics and responsible data practices are viewed as evolving areas requiring continuous learning and dialogue within the university community.

### **Synthesis, Strategic Outlook, and Recommendations**

The University of Missouri demonstrates a growing and strategically important commitment to integrating advanced computational sciences with its programs in forestry, conservation, environmental science, and natural resources. This assessment reveals a multifaceted landscape characterized by significant strengths, emerging opportunities, and areas warranting further development.

Recap of Key Strengths:  
MU possesses a strong academic foundation within the School of Natural Resources, highlighted by SAF-accredited forestry programs 24 and the integration of foundational quantitative and GIS skills into core undergraduate curricula.19 At the graduate level, specialized courses in quantitative methods, ecological modeling, and advanced geospatial analysis are available across various emphasis areas within SNR.33 A considerable cohort of faculty across SNR, Geography, Engineering, and MUIDSI actively employs computational methods in their research, with notable expertise in dendrochronology, fire ecology modeling, ecosystem-atmosphere interactions, freshwater ecological modeling, climate modeling, radar meteorology, and advanced geospatial analytics.57 This human capital is supported by a robust and continually modernizing research computing infrastructure, featuring the Hellbender cluster with NVIDIA A100 GPUs, contributions to the national Nautilus platform (including the Grace Hopper Superchip), and a comprehensive AI/ML software ecosystem, all governed by generally accessible policies.9 Strategically, both the university-level administration (via MizzouForward and the 2024-2030 Strategic Plan) and CAFNR (through its "Smart Farms, Smart Agriculture" and "Healthy Ecosystems" Grand Ideas) have signaled clear commitments to advancing AI, data science, and sustainability.11 Furthermore, MU is proactively establishing AI governance structures, including an AI Advisory Panel and updated academic honesty policies.105  
Identification of Key Gaps/Challenges:  
Despite these strengths, several challenges and gaps are apparent. A primary concern is the "prerequisite barrier" that may limit undergraduate students in NRSM and Environmental Sciences from readily accessing advanced AI/ML and data analytics courses predominantly housed in the College of Engineering and the Department of Computer Science.62 While graduate students have more flexibility, dedicated pathways for undergraduates need enhancement. The strategic integration of AI/ML into forestry and conservation research and curricula, while emerging, could be more explicitly articulated and supported, similar to the detailed vision for "Smart Agriculture." The accreditation status of the Environmental Sciences BS program remains ambiguous from the provided documentation.20 Finally, while general RCR training is in place, ensuring that researchers and students receive adequate, specialized training in data management ethics for large datasets and the unique ethical considerations of computational environmental science and AI in conservation is an ongoing need.  
Strategic Outlook:  
The University of Missouri is well-positioned to solidify and expand its role as a significant contributor to the application of computational sciences in addressing complex environmental and natural resource challenges. The confluence of established expertise in traditional environmental disciplines, burgeoning strength in data science and AI, strategic institutional investments, and robust computing infrastructure creates a fertile ground for impactful interdisciplinary research and the training of highly skilled graduates. Success will depend on systematically bridging existing disciplinary silos, fostering deeper collaborations between CAFNR, Engineering, Arts & Science, and MUIDSI, and ensuring that computational tools and ethical frameworks are accessible and effectively integrated across relevant programs.  
**Recommendations:**

To further enhance its capabilities and impact at the intersection of natural/environmental sciences and advanced computational disciplines, the University of Missouri should consider the following strategic actions:

1. **Curriculum Enhancement and Accessibility:**  
   * **Develop Bridging Mechanisms:** Actively explore and implement solutions to mitigate prerequisite barriers for CAFNR undergraduates seeking to access advanced AI/ML and data science courses. This could involve creating tailored bridging courses, dedicated sections of existing CS/STAT courses for non-majors with relevant applied examples, or revising NRSM/EnvSci curricula to better align with foundational requirements for computational tracks.  
   * **Foster Interdisciplinary Course Development:** Incentivize the creation of new, co-taught courses and specializations at both undergraduate and graduate levels focusing on themes like "AI for Environmental Sustainability," "Computational Ecology and Conservation," or "Data-Driven Natural Resource Management." These should be designed with input from faculty in both CAFNR and computational science departments.  
   * **Strengthen Data Ethics Training:** Integrate more explicit modules on large-scale data management ethics, algorithmic bias in environmental models, and the responsible use of AI in conservation within existing NRSM and Environmental Science courses and the CITI RCR training pathways relevant to these disciplines.  
2. **Faculty and Research Advancement:**  
   * **Strategic Interdisciplinary Hires:** Prioritize future faculty recruitment that includes joint appointments between CAFNR (particularly SNR) and MUIDSI, the College of Engineering (CS/ECE), or the Department of Statistics, focusing on individuals with demonstrated expertise in applying AI/ML to ecology, forestry, climate science, conservation technology, or water resources.  
   * **Catalyze Large-Scale Grant Proposals:** Form interdisciplinary teams to proactively target major federal funding opportunities (e.g., NSF, USDA, DOE, EPA) that focus on AI and data science for environmental sustainability, ecosystem forecasting, and natural resource management, building on existing successes like the SENS-D project.  
   * **Promote HPC Utilization in CAFNR:** Implement targeted outreach, training workshops, and seed grant programs to encourage and support CAFNR researchers and graduate students in leveraging MU's advanced HPC resources (especially Hellbender GPUs and Nautilus) for their environmental and natural resource research.  
3. **Infrastructure and Support Systems:**  
   * **Sustain HPC Investment:** Continue strategic investment in HPC infrastructure, including proactively addressing potential power and cooling limitations for GPU-intensive computing to ensure scalability and reliability.  
   * **Dedicated CAFNR Computational Support:** Explore establishing dedicated IT and data science support liaisons with specific expertise in environmental and natural resource data and models to assist CAFNR faculty and students in effectively utilizing computational resources and methodologies. This could be a role embedded within CAFNR but closely linked to ITRSS and MUIDSI.  
4. **Accreditation and Policy Refinement:**  
   * **Clarify Environmental Science Accreditation:** Undertake a formal review of the BS in Environmental Sciences program to determine the appropriateness and feasibility of seeking specialized accreditation from a relevant body (e.g., EHAC, or other emerging environmental science accreditation entities), aligning with the program's specific educational objectives and career outcomes for its graduates.  
   * **Advance AI Ethics Guidelines:** Task the AI Advisory Panel with developing and disseminating more granular guidelines on the ethical application of AI in research specific to environmental and natural resource data. This should include considerations for spatial data privacy, potential biases in environmental models derived from AI, and the societal implications of AI in conservation and resource management.

By addressing these areas, the University of Missouri can further harness the transformative power of computational science to advance its land-grant mission, producing cutting-edge research and well-prepared graduates ready to tackle the pressing environmental and natural resource challenges of the 21st century.
