* **Water Resources:** This specialization mandates M 171 Calculus I and M 172 Calculus II. Upper-division biology options include GPHY 474 UAV Remote Sensing for Field Ecology, a direct application of remote sensing technology.11 Physical science options like GEO 420 Hydrogeology and GEO 421 Hydrology are heavily reliant on modeling and quantitative analysis.11

A noteworthy course, ENSC 474 Environmental Analytics, focuses on applied statistical and data mining techniques for environmental problem-solving, including methods like point analysis, location suitability analysis, spatial regression modeling, time series analysis, spatial interpolation, and forecasting.16 This course, listed under the general Environmental Sciences (ENSC) prefix and designated as an undergraduate-graduate level offering 16, signifies a recognized need for advanced data analysis skills beyond foundational statistics in the environmental sciences. While not explicitly required in the FCFC ESS specializations detailed in the provided materials, its content is highly pertinent. The existence of such a course, which covers data mining and spatial regression, represents a significant step towards more sophisticated analytical capabilities. Its current catalog placement suggests it may serve a broad student base or is a newer offering that could be more deeply integrated into relevant FCFC specializations in the future, potentially acting as a critical bridge for students aiming to apply AI/ML techniques in environmental contexts.

3\. B.S. Wildlife Biology (Terrestrial and Aquatic):

Wildlife biology is inherently data-rich, involving animal counts, habitat measurements, and telemetry data. The curriculum's requirements ensure students can manage and interpret this data. Modern wildlife conservation increasingly relies on sophisticated modeling techniques, some of which employ or border on machine learning (e.g., image analysis from camera traps, complex habitat suitability modeling). Thus, these foundational courses serve as vital stepping stones for students who may pursue advanced studies or research roles where AI and computational modeling are prevalent.

4\. Geography Programs & Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Certificate:  
The W.A. Franke College of Forestry and Conservation offers a GIS Certificate, which functions as an important interdisciplinary credential.1 This certificate requires a minimum of 18 semester credit hours, encompassing core GIS and remote sensing courses, along with electives that cover advanced applications and require a minimum GPA of 3.0 for the courses within the program.20  
Core GIS/Remote Sensing courses for the certificate include:

* Introduction to GIS: FORS 250 Intro to GIS for Forest Mgt or GPHY 284 Intro to GIS and Cartography.20  
* Photogrammetry/Remote Sensing: FORS 351 Env Remote Sensing or GPHY 487 Remote Sensing/Raster GIS (with GPHY 489 Lab).20  
* Applications: FORS 350 Forestry Apps of GIS or GPHY 488 Applications of GIS.20 Relevant electives for the certificate demonstrate breadth, including ANTY 452 GIS in Archaeology, CSCI 444 Data Visualization, FORS 505 Sampling Methods, GPHY 474 UAV Remote Sensing for Field Ecology, GPHY 481 Advanced Cartographic Design, GPHY 485 Internet GIS, WILD 562 Wildlife Habitat Modeling, and GPHY 587 Image Analysis & Modeling.20 While older catalogs reference a B.S. in Geography with a Physical Geography option that had strong GIS/remote sensing components 22, current materials highlight a Geography Minor within FCFC.1 The GIS Certificate, with its blend of forestry (FORS) and geography (GPHY) courses and electives such as CSCI 444 Data Visualization and WILD 562 Wildlife Habitat Modeling, serves as a critical interdisciplinary hub for developing advanced computational skills. GIS and remote sensing are foundational for many environmental AI applications (e.g., land cover classification, habitat mapping, change detection). The certificate's structure ensures core competency, and the inclusion of diverse electives shows explicit connections to broader data science and modeling disciplines, equipping certificate holders to bridge domain expertise with these advanced computational tools.

5\. Graduate Programs (M.S. Resource Conservation, M.S. Systems Ecology, Ph.D. Forest and Conservation Sciences):  
These graduate programs emphasize quantitative skills, research methodologies, and offer pathways for integrating AI/ML into thesis or dissertation research.

* **M.S. Resource Conservation (International Conservation and Development concentration):** This program requires courses in research methods (e.g., FORS 505 Sampling Methods, NRSM 500 Conservation and Social Science Methods) and statistics (e.g., FORS 538 Ecological Statistics, WILD 562 Wildlife Habitat Modeling, WILD 571 Estimation of Demographic Parameters, or other approved statistics/mathematics courses).25 The program also notes the availability of specialized coursework in remote sensing/GIS within FCFC.25  
* **M.S. Systems Ecology:** Core courses such as BIOS 532 Ecosystem Ecology 27 and BIOS 534 Integrated Systems Ecology 27 focus on an ecosystem-level approach, examining relationships among physical, chemical, and biotic elements, and the dynamics of coupled natural and human systems. Such studies frequently necessitate modeling and complex data analysis.27 Although explicit AI/ML courses are not listed under the BIOS prefix 27, the inherent nature of systems ecology is highly compatible with these advanced computational methods.  
* **Ph.D. Forest and Conservation Sciences:** This doctoral program prioritizes professional development, intellectual curiosity, and scientific competency over a rigidly prescribed set of courses. Students must complete at least 60 credits beyond the Bachelor's degree, with at least 40 credits in coursework (minimum 20 at the 500-level or above). Specific courses are determined by the student's graduate committee.29 This flexible, committee-driven structure creates a significant opportunity for the deep integration of AI/ML into graduate research, contingent upon faculty expertise and student research interests. The absence of explicitly required AI/ML courses at the graduate level within FCFC programs suggests that such specialization is currently driven more by individual research trajectories and advisor guidance rather than a formalized AI track within these degrees. This structure allows doctoral students interested in AI-driven forestry or conservation research to select relevant AI/ML courses from Computer Science or Mathematical Sciences as part of their elective or research credits, provided appropriate faculty supervision is available. The M.S. programs, with their strong quantitative and modeling requirements, effectively prepare students for such advanced doctoral specialization.

## **V. Computational Research Infrastructure and Support**

The capacity for advanced AI and computational research is heavily dependent on accessible and powerful High-Performance Computing (HPC) resources, including Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), appropriate software stacks, and robust institutional support.

A. High-Performance Computing (HPC) Resources at UM Missoula:  
Information regarding specific HPC clusters, their CPU/GPU specifications, and memory capacity directly managed by and located at the University of Montana, Missoula, is not extensively detailed in the provided materials. Several snippets refer to HPC resources at Montana State University (MSU), such as the Tempest, Snowcrest, Hyalite, and Nautilus clusters.63 It is important to distinguish these from resources primarily dedicated to or housed at UM Missoula.  
The Montana University System (MUS) has a strategic plan goal to "Develop a robust research-computing infrastructure, including high-performance computing, data storage, and analytics capabilities, to support advanced research initiatives and interdisciplinary collaborations" across the system.67 This suggests a system-wide recognition of need. Software solutions like Open OnDemand, which enable web-based access to HPC resources, are mentioned generally and could be implemented at UM Missoula.68 A 2010 document regarding a Western Consortium (which included Montana) discussed improving connectivity and HPC capacity broadly but did not detail UM Missoula's specific facilities at that time.69

The lack of specific details about UM Missoula's dedicated HPC infrastructure in the accessible snippets 70 represents an information gap. Understanding the readily available, on-campus computational power is crucial for assessing the university's capacity to support computationally intensive AI research.

B. GPU Availability:  
MSU's Tempest cluster is equipped with advanced H100 and A100 GPUs.63 Whether UM Missoula researchers have routine, direct access to these MSU resources, or if UM Missoula possesses its own comparable GPU infrastructure for AI/ML workloads, remains unclear from the provided information. GPUs are critical for many deep learning tasks, which are increasingly prevalent in environmental AI research.  
C. Supported AI/ML Software Stacks:  
Standard AI/ML software, including Python, R, and deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, are widely used in the academic research community. The specific availability and support for these stacks on any UM Missoula-managed HPC systems are not detailed. However, research activities at UM indicate the use of such tools. For example, NTSG employs recurrent neural networks and machine learning algorithms 43, and Dr. Jordan Malof's research utilizes Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), specific architectures like ResNet and SwinUnet, and various loss functions common in deep learning frameworks.53 This implies that researchers are accessing and utilizing appropriate software environments, though the specifics of centrally supported stacks are not clear.  
D. Access Policies for Researchers and Students:  
Access policies for any UM Missoula-specific HPC resources are not detailed in the snippets. For comparison, MSU's Tempest cluster operates on a "buy-in model".64 Clear and accessible policies are important for fostering broad research use.  
E. Research IT Support Services:  
The MUS strategic plan aims to enhance IT infrastructure and support system-wide.67 However, specific details regarding UM Missoula's research IT support services dedicated to computational research, AI/ML development, or HPC utilization were not available from the accessible sources.70  
While the Montana University System has articulated strategic goals for robust research computing, and MSU clearly possesses significant HPC/GPU infrastructure, the specifics of readily accessible, UM Missoula-based HPC resources dedicated to AI/ML research are not well-defined in the provided information. This ambiguity could represent a potential limiting factor for some computationally intensive research or may indicate reliance on external or collaborator resources. Further investigation into UM Missoula's direct HPC capabilities would be necessary for a complete assessment.

## **VI. Strategic Vision and Ethical Framework for AI Research**

The University of Montana's broader strategy concerning AI and data science, alongside its approach to the ethical considerations inherent in this rapidly evolving field, are crucial for sustainable and responsible research growth.

A. University of Montana's Strategic Priorities for AI, Data Science, and Computational Research:  
A specific, dedicated strategic plan for AI and data science at the University of Montana, Missoula, was not identified in the accessible materials.72 However, the Montana University System (MUS) strategic plan does include a priority to "Develop a robust research-computing infrastructure, including high-performance computing, data storage, and analytics capabilities, to support advanced research initiatives and interdisciplinary collaborations".67 This system-level objective provides a supportive context for UM Missoula's endeavors in these areas.  
There is evidence of grassroots adoption and success in AI-related research at UM. Professors are reportedly using AI in various fields, attracting international attention, such as a biology professor applying machine learning to lung cancer research and another faculty member studying the creative capabilities of GPT-4.31 These instances, along with the specialized AI research in environmental remote sensing and modeling (see Section IV), indicate a growing momentum from faculty-led initiatives. Furthermore, the state of Montana is acknowledging the importance of AI literacy, exemplified by the introduction of an online high school AI course through the Montana Digital Academy.31

The current landscape suggests that while a dedicated top-down AI strategic plan for UM Missoula may not be explicitly visible from the provided information, the combination of MUS-level goals and existing faculty-driven research successes indicates a fertile ground for future strategic development. A key challenge and opportunity for the university will be to harness this organic growth with focused institutional investment and support, particularly in dedicated computational infrastructure (as discussed in Section V) and the further development of interdisciplinary academic programs.

B. W.A. Franke College of Forestry & Conservation's Vision for Advanced Computational Methods:  
The W.A. Franke College of Forestry & Conservation (FCFC) demonstrates a strong, practical vision for the integration of advanced computational methods, evident through the activities of its research centers and faculty. The Numerical Terradynamic Simulation Group (NTSG) is explicitly "pioneering the use of computational ecology and satellite remote sensing".43 Similarly, the National Center for Landscape Fire Analysis (NCLFA) is actively "developing applications to help managers access and use data more efficiently" and employing technologies like laser scanning and 3D modeling for fire and fuels research.46 This hands-on engagement with cutting-edge computational tools signifies a de facto strategic direction.  
Furthermore, the expectations for positions like the Endowed Chair in Forest Conservation, who is tasked with maintaining an innovative, extramurally funded research program and translating research into practical applications while contributing to the SAF-accredited curriculum 4, imply a commitment to research excellence that naturally incorporates advanced methodologies. While a specific strategic document from FCFC focused solely on AI and data science was not found 73, the college's research output and the nature of its specialized centers clearly indicate that FCFC is a leader within UM in applying sophisticated computational techniques to its domain. A more explicit articulation of an AI/data science strategy could further solidify this leadership, enhance coordination, and attract additional talent and funding.

C. Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) at UM:  
The University of Montana upholds standards for the responsible conduct of research, typically requiring RCR training for its researchers and students.74 A significant institutional asset in this area is the Practical Ethics Center at the University of Montana. In collaboration with the federal Office of Research Integrity (ORI), this center developed a comprehensive Online Research Ethics Course.61 This course covers a range of topics, including general ethical issues in research, individual, institutional, and professional responsibilities, and considerations for animal and human participation in research.  
For specific training requirements, particularly related to Institutional Review Board (IRB) compliance, UM utilizes the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI Program) modules.61 Standard CITI RCR modules typically address data management, authorship, peer review, research misconduct, and conflicts of interest.75

AI/Data Ethics Specifics:  
The provided information does not explicitly state that UM's standard CITI RCR training includes dedicated modules specifically focused on AI ethics or the nuanced ethical considerations of research data beyond general data management principles. Global discussions on AI ethics highlight concerns about algorithmic bias, transparency, accountability, and the potential for misuse of AI technologies 76, issues that are highly relevant to AI applications in environmental science (e.g., biases in predictive models for resource allocation or species management).  
The Online Research Ethics Course developed by UM's Practical Ethics Center covers "Ethical Issues in Research" and "Data Acquisition and Management".61 While these are foundational, the depth of coverage regarding specific AI ethical dilemmas—such as ensuring fairness and equity in AI-driven environmental decision-making, the ethics of using large-scale environmental datasets collected via remote sensing or AI-powered tools, or the explainability of complex AI models used in conservation—is not detailed in the available snippets.

The existence of the Practical Ethics Center and its comprehensive general research ethics course positions UM well to address emerging ethical challenges. However, the rapid evolution of AI and its unique ethical implications may necessitate specific updates or supplementary training programs. Given the increasing application of AI in research at UM, proactively developing guidelines and training modules that specifically address AI ethics, potentially housed within or developed in collaboration with the Practical Ethics Center, would be a valuable step in ensuring responsible innovation.
