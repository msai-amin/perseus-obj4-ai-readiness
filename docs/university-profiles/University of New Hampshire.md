## **Academic Programs in Forestry, Conservation, and Environmental Sciences**

### **A. Overview of Relevant Degree Programs (Undergraduate and Graduate)**

The University of New Hampshire offers a comprehensive suite of academic programs dedicated to the study and management of natural resources and the environment, primarily housed within the College of Life Sciences and Agriculture (COLSA) and the College of Engineering and Physical Sciences (CEPS).

Within COLSA, the Department of Natural Resources and the Environment (NREN) serves as a significant interdisciplinary hub. NREN champions an integrated approach by combining applied social sciences with natural resource sciences, fostering a holistic perspective on resource use and conservation.3 This department offers several Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degrees, including a Bachelor of Science in Forestry (B.S.F.) 6, Environmental Sciences (with options such as Ecosystems and Soil and Watersheds) 7, Wildlife and Conservation Biology 7, Environmental Conservation and Sustainability 4, and Environmental and Resource Economics.4 The breadth of these undergraduate offerings highlights COLSA's central role in educating future environmental professionals and scientists.

The College of Engineering and Physical Sciences (CEPS) contributes with a B.S. in Environmental Engineering, a program designed to apply engineering principles to solve environmental problems.10 This program complements COLSA's offerings by providing an engineering-focused pathway for students interested in environmental protection and remediation.

At the graduate level, UNH provides advanced research-based study through NREN's Master of Science (M.S.) in Natural Resources. This program allows for specialization in several areas: Ecosystem Science, Environmental Conservation and Sustainability, Environmental Economics, Forestry, and Wildlife and Conservation Biology.5 These specializations enable students to delve deeply into specific facets of natural resource management and environmental science. Furthermore, UNH offers an interdisciplinary Ph.D. program in Natural Resources & Earth Systems Science (NRESS), which draws faculty and students from various departments, fostering cross-disciplinary research.5 CEPS also provides graduate education through M.S. and Ph.D. programs in Civil & Environmental Engineering.14

The array of these programs, from applied field disciplines such as Forestry to engineering-focused solutions in Environmental Engineering, and culminating in interdisciplinary doctoral studies, demonstrates a robust and comprehensive educational framework at UNH for addressing complex environmental and natural resource issues.

### **B. Programmatic Accreditation and Institutional Quality Assurance**

The University of New Hampshire's commitment to academic quality is affirmed through institutional and programmatic accreditation. The university as a whole is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education (NECHE), ensuring that it meets or exceeds criteria for institutional quality through a peer-review process.15 This overarching accreditation applies to all programs and provides a baseline assurance of educational quality.

Beyond institutional accreditation, several specific programs within the environmental and natural resource disciplines hold specialized programmatic accreditations, which are crucial indicators of professional rigor and adherence to national standards. The Bachelor of Science in Forestry (B.S.F.) degree is accredited by the Society of American Foresters (SAF).6 SAF is recognized by the U.S. Department of Education as the official accrediting body for forestry programs in the United States, and this accreditation signifies that the UNH forestry program provides a sound professional preparation and meets established educational benchmarks for the profession.16

Similarly, the B.S. in Environmental Engineering program, offered through CEPS, is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET.10 ABET accreditation is the global standard for programs in applied science, computing, engineering, and engineering technology, indicating that the program meets the quality standards that produce graduates prepared to enter a global workforce.

The B.S. in Environmental Sciences program, which includes an Ecosystems option, is a joint offering from COLSA and CEPS.8 While the university's general NECHE accreditation covers this program, and specific specialized accreditations for all environmental science programs are not detailed beyond the ABET accreditation for the Environmental Engineering B.S. 15, its inter-college structure is a notable feature designed to provide interdisciplinary breadth.

For the Wildlife and Conservation Biology B.S. program, the curriculum is designed to prepare students for professional certification by The Wildlife Society (TWS).18 It is important to distinguish this from programmatic accreditation; TWS offers certification for individuals (e.g., Associate Wildlife Biologist®, Certified Wildlife Biologist®) based on their education and experience, rather than accrediting the academic program itself.19 The program's alignment with TWS certification requirements is nonetheless a positive attribute, indicating that graduates possess the necessary educational foundation for professional recognition.

The presence of strong programmatic accreditations from SAF and ABET for the Forestry and Environmental Engineering programs, respectively, signals a commitment to external quality validation in these professional fields. This enhances the value of these degrees and the preparedness of their graduates. The interdisciplinary nature of other programs, such as those within NREN 3 and the joint Environmental Sciences degree 8, is a strength for addressing complex, multifaceted environmental issues. Such interdisciplinary breadth, while educationally valuable, can sometimes present challenges in aligning with narrowly defined criteria of specialized accrediting bodies, which may explain why not every distinct environmental specialization has its own unique programmatic accreditation beyond the overarching NECHE review.

## **Integration of Computational and Data Sciences within Environmental Curricula**

### **A. Foundational Quantitative, Geospatial, and Modeling Skills Development**

A critical component of modern environmental science education is the development of strong quantitative, geospatial, and modeling skills. Analysis of UNH's environmental program curricula reveals a consistent emphasis on these foundational areas.

The **Bachelor of Science in Forestry (B.S.F.)** program mandates several courses that build these competencies: NR 658 Introduction to Geographic Information Systems, NR 757 Remote Sensing of the Environment, BIOL 528 Applied Biostatistics I, and NR 749 Forest Inventory and Modeling. Mathematical preparation includes options such as MATH 424B Calculus for Life Sciences, MATH 420 Finite Mathematics, or MATH 425 Calculus I.6 This curriculum ensures forestry graduates are equipped with essential tools for resource assessment and management.

Students in the **B.S. in Environmental Engineering** program are required to take CEE 403 GIS for Civil and Environmental Engineering (or NR 658 as an alternative) and have the option of NR 757 Remote Sensing of the Environment. The mathematics backbone is robust, including Calculus I and II, MATH 527 Differential Equations with Linear Algebra, and a statistics course like MATH 644 Statistics for Engineers and Scientists or MATH 539 Introduction to Statistical Analysis.10 Modeling concepts are integrated into core engineering courses such as CEE 650 Fluid Mechanics and ESCI 654 Fate and Transport in the Environment.10

The **B.S. in Environmental Sciences Major with an Ecosystems Option** requires a statistics course (either BIOL 528 Applied Biostatistics I or NR 525 Statistical Methods and Applications). A key component of this major is the "Environmental Toolkit," where students must select two courses from a list that includes NR 658 Introduction to Geographic Information Systems, ESCI 777 GIS for Earth & Environmental Sciences, NR 757 Remote Sensing of the Environment, ESCI 778 Remote Sensing Earth & Environmental Sciences, and NR 713 Quantitative Ecology. Furthermore, NR 707 Environmental Modeling is available as an advanced course option within the "Ecosystem Integration" category.8

For the **B.S. in Wildlife and Conservation Biology**, core requirements include NR 658 Introduction to Geographic Information Systems (with ESCI 777 as an alternative) and BIOL 528 Applied Biostatistics I. Mathematical foundations are established through MATH 424B Calculus for Life Sciences or MATH 420 Finite Mathematics. NR 713 Quantitative Ecology is offered as an Advanced Ecology Elective.20

At the graduate level, the **M.S. in Natural Resources** program options emphasize an interdisciplinary approach that explicitly incorporates the use of geospatial methods.12 Available coursework across various specializations includes NR 857 Remote Sensing of the Environment, NR 860 Geographic Information Systems in Natural Resources, NR 807 Environmental Modeling, NR 849 Forest Inventory and Modeling, NR 909 Analysis of Ecological Communities and Complex Data, NR 913 Hierarchical Modeling in Ecology, and NR 914 Data Analysis for Natural Resources and Ecology.12

This consistent integration of GIS, statistics, and often remote sensing across all examined undergraduate environmental programs establishes a solid baseline of data handling and analytical skills. Explicit instruction in modeling is present in Forestry and Environmental Sciences, and embedded within Environmental Engineering. The availability of quantitative ecology and advanced data analysis courses at the graduate level further strengthens this foundation. Such skills are indispensable for contemporary environmental research and practice, enabling students to analyze spatial patterns, interpret complex datasets, and predict environmental changes.

### **B. Availability of Specialized AI/ML and Data Science Coursework within Environmental Programs**

While foundational quantitative skills are well-integrated, the curricula for UNH's undergraduate programs in Forestry 6, Environmental Engineering 10, Environmental Sciences: Ecosystems Option 8, and Wildlife and Conservation Biology 20 do not explicitly list required or elective courses with "Artificial Intelligence," "Machine Learning," or "Data Science" in their titles as part of their core departmental offerings for these specific majors. The focus remains primarily on domain-specific applications of established quantitative methods like statistics, GIS, and traditional modeling approaches.

At the M.S. level within the Natural Resources program, several courses delve into advanced quantitative analysis, statistical modeling, and complex data interpretation (e.g., NR 909 Analysis of Ecological Communities and Complex Data, NR 913 Hierarchical Modeling in Ecology, NR 914 Data Analysis for Natural Resources and Ecology).12 These courses provide methodologies closely aligned with data science principles and can serve as a strong foundation for applying AI/ML techniques. However, they are not explicitly framed or titled as AI or ML courses. This suggests that while students in these environmental programs gain essential data handling and analytical skills, direct, in-program exposure to specialized AI/ML concepts and techniques may be limited unless pursued through coursework in other departments.

### **C. Accessibility of Advanced Computational Courses for Environmental Science Students**

Students in environmental programs at UNH who wish to gain deeper expertise in AI, ML, High-Performance Computing (HPC), or advanced data analytics typically need to look to courses offered by departments such as Computer Science (CS), Integrated Applied Mathematics (IAM), and the interdisciplinary Data Science (DATA) program.

Several **AI and ML courses** are available:

* COMP 841 Practical Artificial Intelligence is an option, though its primary prerequisite is COMP 525 Data Structures Fundamentals, a course not typically part of environmental science curricula.21  
* CS 750/850 Machine Learning requires either MATH 539 Introduction to Statistical Analysis or MATH 644 Statistics for Engineers and Scientists, along with a foundational programming course.24 While environmental students take statistics, the required programming proficiency might extend beyond their typical introductory exposure. Foundational CS programming courses include CS 415 Introduction to Computer Science I or CS 410P Introduction to Scientific Programming/Python.25  
* DATA 750 Neural Networks (equivalent to COMP 750\) is listed, particularly within the Data Science major curriculum, following a sequence of prerequisite CS and mathematics courses.25  
* The AI Essentials Certificate Program, offered through UNH Professional Development & Training, consists of workshops aimed at professionals and states "no experience required".33 While potentially useful for an overview, these are unlikely to provide the rigorous academic credit or depth needed for advanced research applications by environmental science students.

For **HPC**, IAM 751/851 Introduction to High-Performance Computing requires a working knowledge of a compiled programming language like C, C++, or Fortran, plus departmental approval.34 This prerequisite implies a programming skill set not commonly developed within standard environmental science tracks.

**Data Science and Analytics courses** offer varied accessibility:

* The B.S. in Data Science is a comprehensive major with extensive mathematics and computer science prerequisites, including multiple calculus courses, linear algebra, probability theory, and a suite of CS courses covering programming, data structures, and algorithms.25 This major does require a minor in an applied discipline, which could be an environmental field, presenting a structured pathway for deep data science integration.25  
* DATA 557 Introduction to Data Science and Analytics appears to be a more accessible entry point, as it states that while programming and statistical software are used, "previous experience is not required".28  
* More advanced courses like DATA 674 Predictive and Prescriptive Analytics I and DATA 757 Mining Massive Datasets build upon DATA 557 and foundational mathematics such as MATH 425 Calculus I.28

The foundational quantitative and geospatial skills embedded in UNH's environmental science curricula are necessary for contemporary environmental analysis. However, these skills alone are likely insufficient for students aiming to deeply engage with advanced AI/ML or HPC methodologies. This creates a potential skills divergence, where environmental science students may possess strong domain knowledge but lack the specific advanced programming, algorithmic thinking, and higher-level mathematics (like linear algebra and advanced probability theory) that are prerequisites for many specialized AI/ML courses offered within Computer Science or the Data Science major.24 Accessing these advanced courses often requires a significant commitment to coursework outside the typical environmental science major requirements, potentially forming a barrier to interdisciplinary computational pursuits for some students.

While introductory data science courses like DATA 557 offer a lower barrier to entry 28, the pathway to more advanced and impactful AI/ML courses generally involves a sequence of mathematical and programming prerequisites typically found within CS or Data Science degree tracks. This structure could inadvertently create a tiered system of access, where CS and Data Science students can more readily pursue advanced computational topics, while environmental science students face a more challenging route. Addressing this requires careful consideration of curricular pathways, robust academic advising, and potentially the development of bridging courses or specialized minors designed to equip environmental science students with the necessary prerequisites for advanced computational study. The existence of a full B.S. in Data Science that encourages a minor in an applied field 25 does, however, signal an institutional recognition of the need for such interdisciplinary connections.

## **Faculty Expertise at the Nexus of Environmental Science and Advanced Computation**

### **A. Profiles of Key Researchers and Their Contributions**

The University of New Hampshire hosts a diverse cadre of faculty members whose research integrates computational methodologies with environmental science, forestry, and conservation. This expertise is notably distributed across several departments within both the College of Life Sciences and Agriculture (COLSA) and the College of Engineering and Physical Sciences (CEPS).

Within COLSA's **Department of Natural Resources and the Environment (NREN)**, several faculty are prominent:

* **Russell Congalton** is a Professor specializing in Remote Sensing and GIS. His work encompasses geospatial analysis, the accuracy assessment of remotely sensed data, habitat mapping (deer, bear, endangered plants), forest change detection, fire and fuels management, and the application of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS).13 His BASAL (Biogeophysical and Spatial Analysis Lab) is a focal point for this research.  
* **Scott Ollinger**, Professor, conducts research in ecosystem ecology and biogeochemistry, with a strong emphasis on carbon and nitrogen cycling, forest productivity, plant-soil interactions, remote sensing (particularly hyperspectral), and ecosystem modeling. He investigates the effects of multiple environmental stressors like ozone, nitrogen deposition, and climate change on forests. Dr. Ollinger leads the Terrestrial Ecosystems Analysis Lab.13

* **John Gibson**, Associate Professor, works on dynamical-systems methods for fluid dynamics, numerical methods, and computational fluid dynamics, all pertinent to environmental modeling.57

This distributed expertise across multiple colleges and departments provides a rich foundation for interdisciplinary approaches to environmental research that leverages advanced computational tools.

### **B. Interdisciplinary Research Clusters and Collaborations**

UNH fosters interdisciplinary research through several formal structures and collaborative initiatives that are particularly relevant to the intersection of environmental science and computation:

* The **Natural Resources & Earth Systems Science (NRESS) Ph.D. Program** is inherently interdisciplinary, drawing faculty advisors and students from NREN, Earth Sciences, ESRC, and other related units. This program structure is designed to promote research that transcends traditional departmental boundaries.13  
* The **Earth Systems Research Center (ESRC)**, a component of the Institute for the Study of Earth, Oceans, and Space (EOS), serves as a crucial nexus, bringing together ecologists, environmental chemists, Earth system modelers, and remote sensing scientists to study environmental change.61  
* The **Computer Science Department** hosts several research groups, including an **Artificial Intelligence Research Group**.63 While not exclusively focused on environmental applications, this group provides a hub for core AI expertise that can be leveraged for collaborative projects.  
* The **Integrated Applied Mathematics (IAM) Program** is another interdisciplinary initiative involving faculty from Mathematics & Statistics, Physics, various Engineering departments, Earth Sciences, and Computer Science. It focuses on applying advanced mathematical and computational methods to solve complex problems in science and engineering.11  
* Evidence of successful **collaborative grants** further underscores this interdisciplinary capacity. The $1 million NSF grant for the Coalition of Northern Forest Innovation and Research, for instance, involves NREN's Mark Ducey for his machine learning expertise, working alongside partners from other universities and organizations to tackle regional forestry challenges.42

These formal programs and research centers, complemented by grant-driven collaborations, create an environment conducive to the cross-pollination of ideas and methods. The distribution of computational expertise across NREN (geospatial analysis, ecosystem modeling), Earth Sciences/ESRC (remote sensing, Earth systems modeling), Civil and Environmental Engineering (hydrologic modeling, sustainable systems modeling, AI applications), and Computer Science (core AI/ML, data-driven decision making) is a notable pattern. This breadth allows for diverse approaches to complex environmental problems. There is a clear critical mass of expertise in geospatial analysis and various forms of environmental modeling, which are well-established research areas at UNH. Concurrently, the application of AI and ML to environmental science is an emerging strength, with key faculty in NREN, CEE, and CS pioneering these methods in their respective domains. Research centers like ESRC and interdisciplinary graduate programs such as NRESS and IAM are pivotal in enabling these collaborations, acting as bridges between faculty housed in different home departments. While these individual and center-level strengths are apparent, a more prominently branded, university-wide strategic initiative focused specifically on "Computational and Data-Driven Environmental Science" or "AI for Environmental Sustainability" could further catalyze these collaborations, enhance visibility, and attract additional resources and talent, building upon the existing, somewhat decentralized, pockets of excellence.

## **High-Performance Computing and Data Analytics Infrastructure**

### **A. Overview of Central HPC Resources (Premise, Marvin, BioMade)**

The University of New Hampshire's Research Computing Center (RCC) is the primary provider of IT support and High-Performance Computing (HPC) resources for the university's sponsored research community. The RCC manages a dedicated data center to support research cyberinfrastructure, including several HPC clusters.64

The principal shared HPC cluster highlighted is **Premise**. This system comprises 48 compute nodes interconnected with 56 Gb FDR InfiniBand networking. Storage solutions include over 225TB of Lustre and 213TB of BeeGFS on ZFS.67 The compute nodes feature a mix of Intel Xeon processors, with configurations offering 24, 32, or 40 cores per node, and main memory capacities ranging from 128GB up to 1TB on select nodes.67 A recent update in September 2024 introduced web-based access to Premise via a customized JupyterLab environment, integrated with the Slurm job scheduler.68

The RCC also mentions two other HPC resources: **Marvin**, described as a CRAY Plasma supercomputer, and another cluster named **BioMade**.64 However, specific technical details, such as processing capabilities, memory, storage, or GPU availability for Marvin and BioMade, were not available in the provided information.69 Thus, Premise stands out as the most clearly documented general-purpose HPC resource for the UNH research community.

### **B. GPU Capabilities and AI/ML Software Ecosystem**

The capacity for AI and Machine Learning research is heavily dependent on the availability of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and a supportive software ecosystem.

GPU Availability:  
Information from the UNH Hubbard Center for Genome Studies (HCGS), likely pertaining to bioinformatics users of Premise, indicates that "Ten compute nodes have NVidia K80 GPUs".67 An older communication from 2017 mentioned four nodes with GPUs 71, suggesting an increase over time, though the K80 is an older GPU architecture. The current availability of more recent, powerful GPUs on Premise, or any GPU specifications for the Marvin or BioMade clusters, is not detailed in the provided materials. This is a critical factor, as modern deep learning workloads benefit significantly from newer GPU architectures.  
Supported AI/ML Software Stacks:  
The RCC has recently made significant strides in supporting AI/ML workflows, particularly on the Premise cluster. As of September 2024, the Premise JupyterLab environment offers 68:

* **Python and R:** Native support for creating and running Python and R Jupyter notebooks, with automatic integration with the Slurm job scheduler and access to Premise file systems.  
* **PyTorch:** The Python environment on Premise now provides "full support for Pytorch, the Hugging Face libraries, and other LLM related features." A range of open-source Large Language Model (LLM) models are also pre-installed. This explicit and recent support for PyTorch, a leading deep learning framework 72, and the Hugging Face ecosystem (a major repository for pre-trained models) is a substantial enhancement for AI researchers.  
* **JupyterLab:** The web-based JupyterLab interface itself lowers the barrier to entry for HPC utilization, offering a more user-friendly environment compared to traditional command-line access.68

While the September 2024 announcement for Premise 68 did not explicitly mention **TensorFlow** in the new JupyterLab features, it is a widely used AI framework. General HPC documentation from other institutions indicates TensorFlow's common availability on such systems.73 A UNH master's thesis from 2020 also references the use of TensorFlow for deep learning and computer vision, implying it can be run on UNH systems.76 Given the strong Python support on Premise, researchers can likely install and use TensorFlow, but the level of official, optimized support is not as clearly articulated as it is for PyTorch.

The recent strategic enhancement of the Premise cluster with a web-based JupyterLab interface and explicit, full support for PyTorch and Hugging Face libraries 68 marks a significant step by the RCC. This development directly addresses the needs of the growing AI/ML research community by providing a more accessible and functional environment, which is particularly beneficial for environmental scientists who may be newer to HPC and AI tools. However, the reliance on older NVIDIA K80 GPUs, if these remain the primary GPU resource 67, could present a bottleneck for computationally intensive, large-scale deep learning model training, which often requires the power of more recent GPU architectures. The lack of specific information on GPU capabilities for the Marvin and BioMade clusters makes it difficult to assess their potential contribution to AI/ML research capacity.

### **C. Access Policies and Support for Researchers and Students**

The Research Computing Center provides a range of support services for the UNH research community. This includes assistance during the grant proposal phase, such as developing data management plans, cyberinfrastructure plans, and providing letters of support detailing available computational resources.64 Post-award, RCC offers services including data management, project website development, software development, and systems administration.77

Access to UNH HPC resources, including the Premise cluster, is generally available to the "UNH Researcher Community," which encompasses faculty, staff, and students.66 A common access model, exemplified by a UNCW service request form (potentially indicative of typical university systems), suggests that students typically gain access by being part of a faculty member's research project.80 Researchers can seek assistance and information through the UNH Research Office Knowledge Base or by contacting RCC support directly via email or phone.65

UNH also has an institutional policy on the Ownership, Management, and Sharing of Research Data. This policy clarifies that while the university retains ownership of research data to comply with legal and sponsor requirements, Principal Investigators are generally permitted to take original research data if they leave the institution, holding it in trust for UNH. Students, however, are typically expected to leave original research data with their Sponsoring Principal Investigator, though they may take copies.81

These access policies appear standard for academic research computing environments. The effectiveness of the support structure, particularly for domain scientists from fields like forestry or conservation who may be new to HPC or advanced AI/ML techniques, will depend on the availability of specialized training and consultation that goes beyond basic HPC operational support. The new JupyterLab interface on Premise 68 is a positive development in making these resources more approachable.

## **Strategic University Directions in AI, Data Science, and Environmental Research**

### **A. University-Wide Strategic Priorities and Vision (e.g., UNH 2030\)**

The University of New Hampshire's overarching strategic vision provides a supportive, albeit general, framework for the advancement of computationally intensive environmental research. The "UNH in 2030" strategic plan identifies "Interdisciplinary Education & Research Excellence" and "Strengthening UNH's Impact" as two of its four primary strategic priorities.82 These priorities encourage the university to "leverage academic excellence, research and innovation impact" and to utilize its "nationally and internationally recognized disciplinary strengths and interdisciplinary activity to create a better understanding of real-world issues".82 Such a framework is inherently conducive to the growth of fields like AI and data science as applied to complex environmental challenges, which are intrinsically interdisciplinary and impact-oriented.

Further reinforcing this direction, the 2021 New Hampshire University Research and Industry Plan (NHURIP), to which UNH is a key contributor, pinpoints Life Sciences and Information Technology as significant drivers of economic growth within the state.83 This external assessment aligns well with potential university investments in research areas that bridge these domains, such as bioinformatics, environmental data science, and AI applications in life and environmental sciences. Earlier institutional planning, such as the 2010 strategic plan, also emphasized creating a "seamless understanding of scholarship, one that affirms the essential interconnectedness of teaching, research and engagement" 84, a philosophy that supports the integration of new computational tools across diverse research fields.

While these university-level strategic documents do not typically single out highly specific research niches like "AI in Forestry," their consistent emphasis on interdisciplinary excellence, research impact, and alignment with state innovation priorities creates an environment where such specialized areas can develop and thrive, particularly if championed at the college or departmental level and supported by external funding opportunities.

### **B. College-Level Strategic Plans (COLSA, CEPS) and Departmental Initiatives**

At the college and departmental levels, strategic directions and ongoing initiatives reflect an increasing engagement with computational and data-intensive approaches in environmental research, though the explicitness of "AI" or "data science" as formal strategic pillars varies.

The **College of Engineering and Physical Sciences (CEPS)** has a strategic plan with a vision to "develop sustainable solutions to grand societal challenges through state-of-the-art pedagogy, top tier research, and impactful engagement".2 A core value is "Excellence in Research and Scholarship," which includes a strategic objective to "Identify Areas of Research Excellence in CEPS for Investment".2 This mechanism provides a pathway for CEPS to formally recognize and invest in burgeoning research areas, which could include AI and data science applications within its departments like Civil and Environmental Engineering, Earth Sciences, Computer Science, or Mathematics and Statistics, should these be prioritized.

The **College of Life Sciences and Agriculture (COLSA)**, through its New Hampshire Agricultural Experiment Station (NHAES), has strategic media plans aimed at enhancing the visibility of its research, teaching, and outreach.85 COLSA's broader messaging emphasizes understanding complex ecosystem impacts and developing sustainable solutions, supported by "leading edge research and hands-on experiences".7 Undergraduate research opportunities within COLSA already involve data management and analysis, population and landscape modeling, and the use of quantitative tools 86, indicating a practical integration of data-focused methods.

The **Department of Natural Resources and the Environment (NREN)** within COLSA actively promotes an integrated approach to resource conservation by blending applied social and natural resource sciences.5 NREN offers Graduate Certificates in Ecological Genomics and Geospatial Science 5, signaling a commitment to specialized skill development in data-intensive environmental fields. Recent departmental news highlights research utilizing drone technology (implying computational image analysis) and new approaches to wildlife research (often involving advanced data modeling).5

Collectively, these strategic elements suggest that while a top-down, university-wide strategic mandate for "AI in Environmental Science" is not explicitly detailed in the provided documents, the general strategic direction towards interdisciplinary research and impact 82 creates fertile ground. The more specific impetus for integrating advanced computational methods appears to be emerging from the strengths and initiatives within colleges like CEPS (with its mechanism to invest in research excellence 2) and departments like NREN (with its specialized certificates and computationally-oriented faculty research 5). External factors, such as the NHURIP's focus on IT and Life Sciences 83 and significant NSF funding for projects incorporating machine learning in forestry 42, also play a crucial role in shaping research priorities and stimulating growth in these intersecting areas.

However, a potential disconnect can be observed between the high-level strategic goals of interdisciplinary excellence and the practical accessibility of advanced computational training for all relevant students, as noted by prerequisite challenges for AI/ML courses (Section IV.C) and the need for clarity on state-of-the-art GPU resources (Section VI.B). Bridging this gap is essential for fully realizing the strategic ambitions. The recent upgrade to the Premise cluster's AI/ML capabilities 68 is a positive step in addressing the resource aspect. Nonetheless, given the considerable faculty expertise (Section V) and foundational programs (Section III), UNH has a clear opportunity to more visibly and cohesively brand its strengths in "AI and Data Science for Environmental Solutions." Such a move could enhance its national profile, attract more targeted funding and talent, and align more directly with the university's strategic priority of "Strengthening UNH's Impact".82

## **Major Research Initiatives, Centers, and Externally Funded Projects**

### **A. Prominent Research Centers and Institutes**

The University of New Hampshire's capacity for computationally-driven environmental research is significantly bolstered by several key research centers and institutes that serve as hubs for interdisciplinary activity and provide essential infrastructure.

The **Institute for the Study of Earth, Oceans, and Space (EOS)** stands out as UNH's largest research enterprise. Formed in 1985, EOS fosters scholarship in Earth, space, and ocean sciences, with a strong emphasis on understanding environmental processes and human impacts. EOS scientists utilize a range of tools including satellites, field studies, and computational modeling.62 Within EOS, the **Earth Systems Research Center (ESRC)** is particularly relevant, bringing together ecologists, environmental chemists, Earth system modelers, and remote sensing scientists to study global environmental change.61 Faculty members like Scott Ollinger and Michael Palace, whose work heavily involves modeling and remote sensing, are affiliated with ESRC.13 The ESRC serves as a critical intellectual and infrastructural hub for large-scale environmental research that inherently relies on advanced computational tools.

The **Research Computing Center (RCC)** is the cornerstone of UNH's cyberinfrastructure, providing advanced IT support, HPC resources (including the Premise, Marvin, and BioMade clusters), data storage solutions, and expert personnel in areas such as GIS, scientific programming, data management, and HPC administration.64 The RCC's role is indispensable for enabling any computationally intensive research across the university, including environmental modeling and data analytics. The synergy between domain-specific research centers like ESRC and the infrastructural support from RCC is fundamental to UNH's capacity in computational environmental science.

While not a research center in the traditional sense, the **Department of Natural Resources and the Environment (NREN)** within COLSA functions as a significant locus for integrated environmental research and education. It offers specialized Graduate Certificates in Geospatial Science and Ecological Genomics, indicating a focus on data-intensive skill development relevant to environmental studies.5

The **Computer Science Department** in CEPS hosts research groups focused on core computational areas, including an **Artificial Intelligence Research Group** and the **TREMA (Text Retrieval Extraction Machine Learning and Analytics) lab**.63 These groups house essential AI/ML expertise that can be, and in some cases is, applied to environmental challenges through collaborations.

It is noteworthy that the provided information does not indicate the existence of a standalone, university-wide institute specifically branded for "AI in Environmental Science" or "Data Science for Sustainability." Instead, research activities at this intersection appear to be conducted within existing departmental structures, established research centers like EOS/ESRC, and through interdisciplinary collaborations supported by the RCC. Academic programs like the B.S. in Data Science 32 contribute to building talent in this area but are distinct from university-wide research institutes. This distributed model allows for deep domain-specific expertise in applying computational tools but might benefit from more formalized coordination mechanisms to achieve broader strategic impact specifically in "AI for the Environment."

### **B. Significant Grants and Collaborative Partnerships**

UNH researchers have demonstrated success in securing external funding for projects that integrate computational methods into environmental science, forestry, and conservation. These grants and partnerships are vital for advancing research and innovation.

A key example is a **$1 million National Science Foundation (NSF) grant** awarded in May 2023, supporting the **Coalition of Northern Forest Innovation and Research**. UNH forestry researchers, notably Professor Mark Ducey from NREN, are integral partners in this initiative. Professor Ducey contributes his expertise in forest sampling, geospatial methods, and specifically **machine learning**.42 This project aims to accelerate innovations in forest ecosystem management and forest products across Northern New England, highlighting a direct application of ML in a significant, externally funded forestry project.

The **NSF-supported AWESOME (Andean-Amazonian Watershed Experience: Exploring Sustainability of Mountain Ecosystems in Ecuador) program** provides UNH undergraduate and graduate students with opportunities for collaborative international research.90 This program focuses on critical environmental issues such as watershed management, hydrologic regulation, biogeochemical cycling, and carbon storage, often involving the collection and analysis of extensive field data, with potential for computational modeling of ecosystem responses.91

Individual faculty members have also secured prestigious grants for computationally intensive research. **Michael Palace** (Earth Sciences/ESRC) has been a Principal Investigator on multiple remote sensing projects funded by agencies including NASA, NSF, USDA, USGS, and DOD.45 **Weiwei Mo** (Civil and Environmental Engineering) is a recipient of an NSF CAREER Award for her research on sustainable and resilient communities, which explicitly employs computational methods like system dynamics modeling and machine learning.50

The **NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) program** is a national initiative that invests heavily in interdisciplinary graduate training in high-priority areas, including AI, climate resiliency, and Big Data.92 While no specific UNH NRT award focused directly on "AI for Environmental Science" was identified in the provided materials, UNH is eligible to compete for such funding. Securing an NRT grant in this domain could significantly enhance graduate training and further institutionalize interdisciplinary computational approaches, aligning with UNH's strategic goals for research excellence and building upon existing strengths like the NRESS Ph.D. program.13

These examples demonstrate that NSF, in particular, serves as a major catalyst for advancing computationally-focused environmental research and innovation at UNH. The university's ability to secure such funding underscores the recognized expertise of its faculty and its competitiveness in addressing complex environmental challenges through advanced computational approaches. These grants not only provide vital resources but also align UNH's research directions with national priorities, often fostering collaborations with other institutions and organizations.

## **Framework for AI Ethics and Responsible Conduct of Research**

### **A. University Policies and Guidelines on AI Ethics**

The University of New Hampshire is actively engaging with the ethical dimensions of artificial intelligence, particularly generative AI, by establishing institutional guidance and providing resources to its research community. The university offers guidance on "Using Artificial Intelligence in a University Setting" and has implemented a "USNH Artificial Intelligence Standard".94

A dedicated committee, operating under the UNH Responsible Conduct of Research & Scholarly Activity Program, is tasked with developing guidelines for the ethical use of generative AI in research and scholarly activities.95 This committee organized a virtual workshop in October 2024 titled “Balancing Innovation & Integrity: Exploring the Ethics of Using Generative AI in Research,” making the recording available as a resource for the UNH community.95 This proactive approach of fostering discussion and providing interim guidance is crucial, given that the rapid evolution of AI makes it challenging to finalize comprehensive policies quickly.95

Key ethical considerations highlighted by UNH include the potential for bias in training data leading to discriminatory outcomes or misrepresentations, issues of plagiarism, the misuse of AI for creating deepfakes, concerns about user privacy, inequities in access and impact, and the significant energy consumption associated with training and running large AI models.94

To address privacy and data security, UNH provides and recommends specific AI tools:

* **DeepThought AI:** This is a USNH-developed platform that operates on a local UNH HPC cluster. A significant advantage of DeepThought AI is that user data does not leave the USNH network and is not used to train external LLMs, making it suitable for research involving sensitive data or requiring high-volume queries.94  
* **Copilot (Microsoft):** This tool is recommended for general use by faculty, staff, and students. When accessed via USNH authentication, the free version offers data protections, ensuring that data is not monitored, shared, or provided to third parties.94

This approach, characterized by providing guidance, approved tools with built-in data protections, and fostering open discussion while formal policies continue to mature, reflects a pragmatic and responsible strategy for navigating the complex ethical landscape of AI in an academic research environment.

### **B. Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) Training Programs and Requirements**

UNH maintains a robust framework for Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) and Scholarly Activity, designed to cultivate a climate of integrity across all research endeavors.96 Research Integrity Services plays a central administrative role in this program.97

Participation in RCR training is mandatory for researchers, including students and faculty, who are supported by federal funding agencies such as the National Science Foundation (NSF), the USDA National Institute for Food and Agriculture (NIFA), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH).97 To meet these requirements, UNH utilizes the online Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) Program, which is accessible to all USNH faculty, staff, and students via their institutional Single-Sign-On credentials.98

The NSF RCR training requirements at UNH are tiered according to the researcher's academic level 98:

* **Undergraduate Students:** Must complete a web-based CITI RCR course followed by participation in a half-day RCR seminar.  
* **Master's Students:** Have the option of completing the web-based CITI course and the half-day seminar, or successfully completing the graduate course GRAD 930: Ethics in Research and Scholarship.  
* **Doctoral Students:** Can fulfill the requirement through the CITI course and seminar, GRAD 930, or by completing the UNH doctoral RCR training mandated by the Graduate School for all new doctoral students.  
* **Postdoctoral Researchers:** Follow requirements similar to Master's students (CITI course and seminar, or GRAD 930).  
* **Faculty and Other Senior Personnel:** (Under a new NSF requirement effective for proposals submitted after July 31, 2023\) Must complete either a web-based CITI RCR course or GRAD 930\.

NIH RCR training requirements are also addressed through UNH's program, which incorporates NIH stipulations such as a minimum of eight contact hours of instruction and a mandatory in-person component (online-only training is not sufficient for NIH). Training is required at least once during each career stage and no less frequently than every four years.97 UNH resources supporting this include RCR workshops, GRAD 930, and various web-based instructional modules.97

The university also has a formal policy and procedures for addressing Misconduct in Scholarly Activity.96 To further support the research community, the UNH Library maintains a comprehensive Research Guide on RCR & Scholarly Activity, which notably includes a section on the ethical use of Generative AI Writing Tools.100 This integration of emerging AI ethical considerations into the established RCR framework is a significant step towards ensuring that researchers are aware of and equipped to handle the novel challenges posed by these technologies. The tiered and agency-specific nature of UNH's RCR training demonstrates a nuanced approach to research integrity education, ensuring relevance and adherence to funder mandates.

## **UNH's Capacity for Computationally-Driven Environmental Research**

**Areas for Potential Enhancement/Clarification:**

* **Bridging Computational and Environmental Curricula:** While foundational computational skills are taught, clearer and more accessible pathways are needed for environmental science students (both undergraduate and graduate) to gain proficiency in advanced AI/ML and HPC. This could involve developing targeted minors, certificates, or bridging courses that address the prerequisite gap for upper-level Computer Science or Data Science offerings.  
* **State-of-the-Art GPU Resources:** While Premise offers GPU capabilities (NVIDIA K80s were noted 67), these are an older architecture. For UNH to remain competitive in high-demand AI/ML research, particularly deep learning, continued investment in and transparent communication about the availability of newer, more powerful GPU resources across its HPC infrastructure is crucial. Details on the capabilities of the Marvin and BioMade clusters, especially regarding GPUs, would be beneficial.  
* **Strategic Cohesion for "AI/Data Science for Environment":** Although many components exist, a more explicitly articulated and strategically coordinated university-wide initiative focusing on "AI and Data Science for Environmental Solutions" could amplify existing strengths, improve visibility, attract targeted funding and talent, and foster more systematic collaborations between environmental domain experts and core computational scientists.  
* **Specialized Support and Training:** Beyond general HPC support, providing specialized training and consultation for environmental researchers on how to effectively leverage AI/ML tools and HPC resources for their specific domain problems would be highly beneficial.

Overall Assessment:  
UNH possesses significant foundational elements—strong environmental programs, dedicated faculty, core computational infrastructure, and a commitment to ethical research—that position it as a capable institution for computationally-driven environmental research. The university is demonstrating an adaptive capacity, particularly in its recent upgrades to HPC support for AI/ML and its evolving approach to AI ethics.
