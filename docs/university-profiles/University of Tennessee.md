### **A. University Policies on AI Use, Data Governance, and Intellectual Property**

UTK has begun to formalize its approach to AI governance through system-wide policies and by fostering research into information integrity.

* **University of Tennessee System-wide Policy on Artificial Intelligence (BT0035):** This policy, effective as of its drafting, aims to strike a balance between harnessing the innovative potential of AI and upholding critical values such as academic integrity, the protection of sensitive information, and compliance with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations. It provides a broad framework of system-wide expectations, while granting individual campuses the flexibility to issue more specific academic procedures, guidelines, or restrictions regarding the responsible and ethical use of AI for instructional and assignment purposes. A key tenet of this policy is that faculty members responsible for course delivery are tasked with determining whether, when, and how AI may be used in their courses. They are expected to clearly communicate these permitted uses to students. Students, in turn, are responsible for adhering to these course-specific requirements and are advised that unpermitted use of AI technology constitutes academic misconduct, subject to the campus's student code of conduct. The policy also mandates that Protected University Data must not be entered into AI technologies that have not been reviewed and authorized by the University's Chief Information Officer or designee, with the University maintaining a list of approved AI resources. This proactive policy framework indicates a thoughtful approach to integrating AI responsibly into academic and research settings.  
* **UTHSC AI Policy as a Model:** While specific to the UT Health Science Center, its comprehensive AI policy offers a valuable model of ethical principles that can inform practices across the UT system. This policy emphasizes core ethical tenets:  
  * **Respect for individuals:** Upholding dignity and rights.  
  * **Beneficence:** Ensuring AI contributes to positive outcomes and avoids harm.  
  * **Justice:** Committing to equitable access to AI benefits.  
  * **Transparency:** Striving for clarity in AI use to build trust. It also details stringent requirements for data governance (including adherence to HIPAA and FERPA), compliance with laws, obtaining informed consent for data use in AI, establishing accountability and oversight structures, and implementing robust security and risk management protocols for AI systems.  
* **Information Integrity Institute:** Located within the College of Communication and Information (CCI), the Information Integrity Institute harnesses interdisciplinary faculty expertise to research the mechanisms shaping how the public consumes, shares, and is influenced by information, particularly in the current complex media ecosystem. Its mission includes supporting research on false and misleading information and deception across various domains (environmental, health, political, commercial, social networks) and engaging with stakeholders to broaden knowledge on information integrity issues. While not exclusively an AI ethics body, its work is highly relevant to understanding and mitigating the risks associated with AI-generated misinformation and ensuring the ethical dissemination of AI-driven information.

These policies and institutional structures demonstrate a proactive effort by the University of Tennessee to create a governance framework that supports innovation in AI while safeguarding ethical principles and institutional values.

### **B. Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) in the Context of AI**

The principles of Responsible Conduct of Research are fundamental to all scholarly activities at UTK, and existing RCR frameworks are adaptable to address the unique ethical considerations emerging from AI research.

* **UT Institute of Agriculture (UTIA) RCR Training:** UTIA mandates RCR training for all undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers financially supported by National Science Foundation (NSF) grants. This requirement can be met by completing the UTIA online Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) RCR training course, which covers core areas such as Authorship, Data Management, Plagiarism, and Research Misconduct. Alternatively, approved RCR academic credit courses (e.g., ANSC 525 / CEM 525 / PLSC 525 – Research Ethics for the Life Sciences) or UTIA-approved RCR workshops can fulfill this requirement.  
* **Office of Research, Innovation, and Economic Development (ORIED) Commitment:** ORIED actively supports and nurtures a "strong culture of research integrity" across the university. This office plays a role in helping faculty develop competitive proposals and provides guidance on research compliance.

The established RCR training mechanisms, particularly those within research-intensive units like UTIA, provide a solid foundation for addressing the ethical challenges unique to AI. Core RCR topics such as data management become even more critical when dealing with the massive datasets often used in AI, raising questions about bias, privacy, and security. Authorship conventions need to adapt to research involving significant AI contributions. Concerns about plagiarism may extend to the appropriate use and citation of AI-generated content. Furthermore, research misconduct could involve the misuse of AI tools or the misrepresentation of AI-generated data. While current RCR programs may not yet be fully tailored to AI-specific issues, they offer an existing structure that can be expanded and adapted to incorporate training on algorithmic bias, the ethics of autonomous systems, transparency in AI models, and the intellectual property implications of AI-generated work, aligning with the principles set forth in broader university AI policies like BT0035.

## **Future Outlook**

The University of Tennessee, Knoxville has laid a strong foundation for becoming a prominent player in the field of Artificial Intelligence research and education. Its strategic initiatives, growing academic programs, dedicated research centers, significant HPC infrastructure, and burgeoning faculty expertise collectively point towards a future of continued growth and impact.
