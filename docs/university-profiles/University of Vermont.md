### **Introduction**

The University of Vermont (UVM) articulates a foundational mission centered on societal and planetary well-being, encapsulated in its motto "For People and Planet," and reinforces the principle that "Research is a public good".1 This guiding philosophy inherently aligns the institution's research endeavors with critical environmental and sustainability challenges. This commitment is substantiated by UVM's designation as an "R1: Doctoral Universities—Very high research activity" institution by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education, a status reflecting its significant research output and doctoral program offerings. For the 2025 fiscal year, UVM attracted $266 million in research and development funding, underscoring its capacity for sophisticated and resource-intensive investigations.2

The combination of UVM's R1 status and its historical recognition as a "Public Ivy"—a term coined by Richard Moll in 1985 to denote top public universities offering an Ivy League-caliber education 2—with its explicit mission "For People and Planet" 1, cultivates a distinctive environment for impactful research. The R1 classification signifies a robust infrastructure, substantial research expenditures, and a high volume of doctoral graduates, all ofwhich are prerequisites for advanced computational research, including artificial intelligence (AI). The "Public Ivy" distinction points to a high-quality academic environment conducive to attracting and nurturing talent. When these attributes are channeled through an institutional mission focused on broad societal and environmental benefits, research efforts, including those in AI, are more likely to be directed towards addressing significant global challenges rather than pursuing purely theoretical or narrowly commercial aims. This synergy fosters a research culture where technological advancement is coupled with a strong sense of public purpose, particularly relevant for AI applications in complex domains like environmental science.

Further bolstering its capabilities in data-intensive fields, UVM has strategically invested in computational infrastructure and interdisciplinary collaboration. A key development is the recent establishment of the university-wide Vermont Complex Systems Institute (VCSI), an evolution of the former Vermont Complex Systems Center. This institute is poised to serve as a central hub for computation, AI, and network science research across the university, signaling a strategic commitment to these cutting-edge fields and their application to diverse problems, including environmental ones.3

UVM has established mechanisms for ensuring responsible research practices and is actively developing its approach to the ethical considerations of AI.

* **Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) Training:** As mandated by the National Science Foundation (NSF), UVM requires RCR training for all faculty, principal investigators (PIs), co-PIs, senior personnel, undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers who are supported by NSF grants. This requirement was expanded effective July 31, 2023, to include all faculty and senior personnel involved in NSF-funded research.107 The training is delivered through the CITI (Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative) Program, specifically the "Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) \- Basic" course. The university's Research Integrity office oversees compliance, notifying individuals and sending reminders.107  
* Beyond general CITI training, specific programs incorporate ethics education. For instance, RSENR's Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) programs include dedicated ethics training, which participants have found valuable for understanding proper research conduct.108  
* The College of Engineering and Mathematical Sciences (CEMS) integrates a "Professional Ethics" competency into its core curriculum. This requires students to consider the ethical implications of their academic disciplines, including societal costs and benefits, environmental justice, and historical perspectives on associated social, economic, environmental, and geopolitical issues.109 This is highly pertinent to the development and deployment of AI technologies.  
* AI Ethics Policies and Principles:  
  UVM is currently in a formative phase regarding the establishment of comprehensive, university-wide AI ethics and governance frameworks.104 However, several initiatives and programmatic commitments indicate a proactive approach:  
  * The Provost's working group on AI has been actively discussing AI-related activities, including ethical considerations. This group has recommended the creation of an ongoing AI Task Force tasked with developing plans for identifying AI best practices, opportunities, and risks, as well as formulating necessary actions and policies.104  
  * The B.S. in Data Science program within CEMS explicitly aims to "instill in our students a strong sense of ethical responsibility when handling data. They will understand the importance of privacy, transparency, and fairness in data science practices, ensuring their work benefits society and individuals".25  
  * While a finalized, university-wide "AI Principles" or "Ethical AI Framework" document was not identified in the available materials 111, the ongoing high-level discussions and program-specific commitments demonstrate a clear awareness of the importance of AI ethics.

The existing foundation of mandatory RCR training and embedded ethics components within curricula provides a strong starting point. The forthcoming AI Task Force, as recommended by the Provost's working group 104, will play a crucial role in shaping specific policies and guidelines for the ethical development and application of AI in research and education across the university. This will be particularly important for AI applications in sensitive environmental contexts, such as those involving biodiversity data, predictive models that influence environmental policy, or AI-driven conservation decision-making, where public trust and responsible innovation are paramount.
