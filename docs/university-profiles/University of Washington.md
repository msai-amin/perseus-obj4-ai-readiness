  The UW Graduate School has issued specific advice for researchers, particularly graduate students, on navigating the use of AI tools.86 Key tenets include:  
  * **Critical Evaluation:** Researchers must maintain skepticism towards AI-generated outputs, diligently fact-check information, and trace findings back to credible original sources.  
  * **Methodical Prompting:** A scientific approach to querying AI tools is recommended, involving careful record-keeping and iterative refinement of prompts.  
  * **Data Confidentiality & IP:** Extreme caution is advised against sharing confidential, proprietary, or intellectually sensitive data with open AI platforms, as this could compromise IP rights or lead to unintended disclosure.  
  * **Adherence to Publisher Policies:** Researchers must be aware of and comply with the AI usage policies of academic publishers and professional societies.  
  * **Transparency:** Full disclosure of AI assistance in research and publications is often required.  
  * **Academic Integrity:** Using AI to generate substantial portions of scholarly work like dissertations or papers may constitute plagiarism or academic misconduct under UW policies. Authorship is reserved for human contributors who can be accountable for the work.  
  * **Data Privacy:** Sensitive research data should never be uploaded to open AI platforms. Researchers must understand the terms of service and data handling practices of any AI tool they use.  
* 2\. Generative AI General Use Guidelines (UW-IT):  
  UW-IT has provided broader guidelines for the university community on the use of generative AI.86 These guidelines emphasize:  
  * **Approved Tools:** Only UW-approved services and applications (listed in UWare) should be used with University data to prevent policy or legal violations.  
  * **Accountability:** Users are ultimately responsible for their use of GenAI and any resulting outcomes.  
  * **Risk Mitigation:** GenAI outputs must be reviewed before use or publication. AI should augment, not replace, human judgment, especially in decisions affecting individuals or communities. Biased outputs and uses that create barriers for underrepresented groups should be avoided.  
  * **Transparency and Recordkeeping:** Disclosure of GenAI use is mandatory. Detailed records, especially when personal data is involved, must be maintained.  
  * **Confidentiality:** Non-public data should only be used with formally reviewed and UW-IT approved GenAI tools.  
* 3\. Department-Specific AI Ethics (Example: Radiology, CSE):  
  Specific departments are also developing tailored AI ethics guidelines. For example, the Department of Radiology has established a "Medical Imaging Artificial Intelligence Governance" policy to manage the clinical use of AI tools for medical imaging, based on best practices from professional bodies like AAPM and ACR.89 This policy emphasizes proactivity, transparency, and scalability.  
  Similarly, the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering offers courses like CSE 582: AI Ethics, which delves into topics such as fairness and bias in machine learning, civility in communication, misinformation, privacy-preserving algorithms, and "Green AI" (energy and climate considerations for large-scale AI models).33 This indicates an academic focus on instilling ethical considerations directly within AI development and application.

The University of Washington's approach to research integrity and AI ethics is multi-faceted, combining established RCR training mechanisms with evolving guidelines specifically addressing the nuances of artificial intelligence. The CITI program serves as a foundational RCR training platform, particularly for meeting federal sponsor requirements. Concurrently, university-wide bodies like the Graduate School and UW-IT, along with individual departments, are developing and disseminating principles for the responsible and ethical use of AI. This evolving framework aims to ensure that as AI becomes more integrated into research, including in environmental science and forestry, it is done in a manner that upholds scientific rigor, protects sensitive information, respects intellectual property, and promotes fairness and transparency. The ongoing challenge lies in the effective dissemination and consistent adoption of these AI ethics guidelines across diverse research domains.
