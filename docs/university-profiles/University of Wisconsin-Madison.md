## **Responsible Innovation: AI Ethics and Research Conduct**

### **Overview**

UW-Madison emphasizes scholarly and ethical standards through established policies for Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) and emerging guidelines addressing the specific challenges of Artificial Intelligence (AI).

### **Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR)**

The university mandates RCR training primarily driven by federal funding agency requirements.

* **Policy Framework**: UW-Madison maintains an overarching RCR Training Policy (UW-4021) and specific policies aligned with major funding agencies.89  
* **Agency-Specific Requirements**:  
  * **NSF**: Requires all PIs, co-Is, faculty, key personnel, postdocs, graduate students, and undergraduate students supported by NSF funding to complete the designated RCR course delivered via the Canvas learning platform.89  
  * **USDA NIFA**: Mandates that PIs, co-Is, and participants (including students and postdocs) supported by NIFA awards, including Capacity (142 Hatch) funds, complete the RCR course in Canvas.89  
  * **NIH**: For specific training grants and awards (e.g., D, F, K, R, T, U series), NIH requires a minimum of eight hours of face-to-face RCR instruction every four years. The specific plan for fulfilling this is typically included in the grant application.89  
* **Training Content**: RCR training typically covers core topics such as scientific integrity, data acquisition and management, data confidentiality and sharing, authorship and publication practices, peer review, mentorship responsibilities, conflicts of interest, research misconduct, and the ethical treatment of human and animal subjects.142 Specific courses like PATH 755 also incorporate rigor, reproducibility, and transparency.141  
* **Delivery Platforms**: While the mandated training for NSF and USDA NIFA utilizes a Canvas course 89, UW-Madison also uses the CITI Program extensively for other compliance training, notably Human Subjects Protection and Good Clinical Practice.91 Some NIH RCR requirements are met through specific departmental courses (e.g., PATH 755, CHEM 701, MED PHYS 701).141 Specific RCR requirements for CALS or the Nelson Institute beyond federal mandates were not detailed in the provided sources.145

The structure of RCR training at UW-Madison appears heavily influenced by compliance needs for federal funding agencies. The use of a dedicated Canvas course for NSF and USDA NIFA requirements, alongside specific departmental courses or plans for NIH grants, suggests a decentralized approach tailored to funder mandates rather than a single, university-wide RCR training program required for all researchers regardless of funding source.89 While CITI is used for other compliance areas, its role in fulfilling general RCR requirements (outside of specific grant needs) is less clear from the documentation.91

### **AI Ethics and Governance**

As AI becomes more prevalent, the university is addressing its ethical implications, although a comprehensive, university-wide policy framework seems to be evolving.

* **General Guidelines & Academic Integrity**: The university expects students to uphold academic integrity when using AI tools. Crucially, students are responsible for understanding and adhering to individual instructors' policies regarding AI use in coursework; unauthorized use can constitute academic misconduct.147 If permitted, proper citation of AI tools is required.147 Students are also cautioned against inputting sensitive information into public AI tools.147  
* **Ethics in Curriculum**: Awareness of AI ethics is integrated into some courses. Examples include Continuing Legal Education (CLE) seminars on AI ethics for lawyers offered by the Law School 148, an iSchool course on Human-Centered Design incorporating AI ethics and accessibility 149, and Computer Science courses discussing fairness, bias, privacy, and Green AI.150  
* **Policy Development**: While specific campus-wide AI ethics policies were not found 151, there is institutional awareness of the need for guidance. UW Medicine has developed a specific AI Governance policy for the use of AI tools in medical imaging, emphasizing transparency, safety, and best practices. Strategic initiatives like RISE-AI also signal institutional attention to AI development and its implications.45  
* **Research Context**: Research projects, particularly within data science and related fields, actively grapple with ethical dimensions, including model fairness, bias mitigation, privacy preservation, and the environmental impact of large-scale AI models (Green AI).6

The current approach to AI ethics at UW-Madison appears somewhat fragmented. Student conduct guidelines focus primarily on academic integrity and instructor discretion.147 Specific units like UW Medicine have developed targeted policies, and relevant ethical topics are discussed within certain courses.148 However, a unified, university-wide framework or mandatory ethics training program specifically for AI development and application across all disciplines was not identified in the available resources.151 This suggests an area of ongoing development as the university navigates the rapid advancement and adoption of AI technologies.
