# **University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point**

## **Introduction**

This report assesses the integration and application of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Data Science, and related advanced computational methods within the natural resource programs and research activities at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point (UWSP). The analysis is based on publicly available information from the university's website and associated documents.

UWSP's College of Natural Resources (CNR) maintains a strong reputation, underscored by key program accreditations (e.g., Society of American Foresters for Forestry) and alignment with professional certifications (e.g., American Fisheries Society, The Wildlife Society). Foundational quantitative skills, particularly statistics and Geographic Information Systems (GIS), are well-integrated across CNR curricula, supported by robust offerings in the Department of Geography and Geology, including a dedicated GIS Center and multiple geospatial academic programs.

However, the integration of more advanced computational methods, specifically AI and ML, into CNR's core undergraduate curricula and stated strategic mission appears limited based on available course descriptions and program goals. While expertise in quantitative methods like biometry, statistics, and domain-specific modeling exists within CNR faculty, dedicated AI/ML technical expertise and coursework are primarily concentrated in supporting departments, namely Computing and New Media Technologies (CNMT) and the Sentry School of Business and Economics (Data Analytics programs). Accessing these advanced courses poses potential challenges for CNR students due to prerequisite requirements outside their typical major pathways.

UWSP leverages shared resources within the University of Wisconsin System, particularly the Blugold Center for High Performance Computing at UW-Eau Claire, to provide access to High-Performance Computing (HPC) capabilities, Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), and standard AI/ML software stacks (Python, R, TensorFlow, PyTorch via Conda). Local, institutionally provided HPC/GPU infrastructure at UWSP is not evident from the reviewed materials, nor is dedicated local support staff specializing in advanced computational research facilitation.

Institutionally, UWSP has established policies for Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) utilizing the CITI program and is developing guidelines for the ethical use of AI in academic settings. However, AI, data science, and computational research are not explicitly highlighted as top-level priorities in the snippets reviewed from the university's main strategic plan ("Purpose Made Possible") or the CNR's mission statements. Established research centers within CNR and Geography focus primarily on monitoring, domain-specific modeling, GIS applications, and outreach, with limited documented evidence of major AI/ML-driven projects.

Strengths lie in the CNR's foundational excellence, strong GIS capabilities, and access to UW System computational resources. Opportunities for development include enhancing the accessibility and integration of AI/ML coursework for CNR students, fostering interdisciplinary research collaborations, potentially investing in local computational resources and specialized support, and explicitly incorporating advanced computational approaches into strategic planning for both the CNR and the institution.

**Context:** The fields of forestry, conservation, environmental science, and natural resource management are increasingly reliant on advanced computational methods to address complex, large-scale challenges. Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Data Science offer powerful tools for tasks such as predictive modeling of ecosystem dynamics, analysis of vast remote sensing datasets, optimization of resource allocation, and understanding complex human-environment interactions.1 The ability to effectively integrate and apply these technologies is becoming crucial for training future leaders and advancing research in these domains.

**Objective:** This report aims to provide a comprehensive assessment of the current capabilities, infrastructure, strategic direction, and potential of the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point (UWSP) concerning the integration of AI, ML, Data Science, and related computational methods within its natural resource programs and research activities. The analysis relies solely on information gathered from publicly accessible sources associated with the university \[User Query\].

**Scope:** The assessment encompasses UWSP's College of Natural Resources (CNR) and relevant supporting academic units, including the Department of Geography and Geology, the Department of Computing and New Media Technologies (CNMT), and the Department of Mathematical Sciences. It examines academic program structures, accreditation, curriculum content related to quantitative methods, GIS, remote sensing, statistics, modeling, AI/ML, and data science. Furthermore, it investigates faculty expertise, available computational resources (including UW System assets and access policies), institutional and college-level strategic plans, relevant research centers and projects, and frameworks for AI ethics and Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) \[User Query\].

## **Academic Landscape: Programs and Curricula**

### **College of Natural Resources (CNR) Program Portfolio and Accreditation**

**Overview:** The College of Natural Resources (CNR) at UWSP is a significant academic unit, recognized nationally for its undergraduate programs.4 It offers a comprehensive education in natural resource management and conservation through six primary disciplines: Environment and Society, Fisheries and Water Resources, Forestry, Paper Science and Chemical Engineering, Soil and Waste Resources, and Wildlife Ecology.5 The College emphasizes an interdisciplinary approach and strongly focuses on immersive, hands-on field experiences, facilitated by its three field stations: Treehaven, Schmeeckle Reserve, and the Central Wisconsin Environmental Station (CWES).4 This educational philosophy aims to create "tomorrow's conservation leaders".5

**Accreditation and Professional Alignment:** External validation through accreditation and alignment with professional standards is evident in several CNR programs:

* **Forestry:** The Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Forestry, encompassing options such as Forest Management, Forest Recreation, Ecosystem Restoration & Management, and Urban and Community Forestry, is explicitly accredited by the Society of American Foresters (SAF).6 This accreditation signifies that the program meets rigorous national standards regarding objectives, curriculum, faculty qualifications, student support, administrative structure, and facilities, ensuring graduates receive a professional forestry degree.6  
* **Fisheries and Water Resources:** The curriculum for the Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences option within the B.S. in Fisheries and Water Resources is structured to meet the minimum course requirements necessary for graduates to pursue individual certification as a certified fisheries professional through the American Fisheries Society (AFS).9  
* **Wildlife Ecology:** The B.S. in Wildlife Ecology and Management program is designed so that its graduates qualify for individual certification as a wildlife biologist by The Wildlife Society (TWS).10  
* **Other Programs:** Specific program-level accreditation details for the Environment and Society, Soil and Waste Resources, or Paper Science and Chemical Engineering programs were not found in the reviewed materials. However, the university as a whole maintains institutional accreditation through the Higher Learning Commission (HLC), reaffirmed in 2019\.11

A distinction exists in how external validation is presented across CNR programs. Forestry holds formal *program* accreditation from SAF 6, which typically involves a comprehensive review of the entire program. In contrast, the documentation for Fisheries and Water Resources 9 and Wildlife Ecology 10 emphasizes that the curriculum meets the *course requirements* for *individual* professional certification through AFS and TWS, respectively. This difference might reflect varying professional standards within the disciplines, historical development, or strategic choices regarding external review processes. Program accreditation generally implies a broader institutional commitment and external scrutiny compared to aligning coursework for individual credentialing pathways.

### **Quantitative and Computational Skills Integration in CNR Curricula**

A review of the required coursework for various CNR undergraduate majors reveals a consistent integration of foundational quantitative and geospatial skills, though advanced computational modeling is less explicitly mandated across the board.

* **Foundational Sciences and Math:** Majors typically require a base in biological sciences (e.g., BIOL 101, 110, 111, 130, 160), chemistry (e.g., CHEM 101 or 105), and sometimes physics (e.g., PHYS 101 or 201\) and geology (e.g., GEOL 104).9 Mathematics requirements generally include calculus (e.g., MATH 111 Applied Calculus or MATH 225 Calculus I) and a dedicated statistics course.9  
* **Statistics:** A course focusing on data analysis and statistical methods is a common thread. Students often fulfill this requirement by taking either FOR 321 \- Natural Resources Data Analysis (offered within CNR) or MATH 255 \- Elementary Statistical Methods (offered by Mathematical Sciences).9 The Wildlife Ecology major also lists WLDL 311 \- Quantitative Methods for Wildlife and Fisheries Research and Management.21 This ensures a baseline competency in statistical reasoning and data handling relevant to natural resource applications.  
* **GIS and Remote Sensing:** Geospatial technologies are clearly emphasized. Most majors require an introductory GIS course, typically GEOG 341 \- Geographic Information Systems I or a discipline-specific alternative like WATR 391 \- GIS Applications in Natural Resources.13 The Forestry major (Forest Management option) additionally requires a remote sensing course, NRES 377 \- Remote Sensing I or GEOG 377 \- Remote Sensing I.15 This signifies a strong commitment to training students in spatial data acquisition, management, and analysis.  
* **Modeling and Advanced Methods:** While foundational quantitative skills are integrated, courses explicitly dedicated to advanced computational modeling are less visible in the required undergraduate curricula based on course titles found in the documentation. Some course titles suggest modeling activities, such as FOR 425 \- Forest Management and Finance 14, WATR 353 \- Fish Population Dynamics 16, or WLDL 353 \- Analysis of Wildlife Populations.21 The Master of Natural Resources (MNR) program includes NRES 771 \- Introduction to Natural and Social Science Research and NRES 773 \- Applied Ecosystem Ecology and Management, which likely involve more advanced quantitative analysis and potentially modeling concepts.22 However, compared to the explicit requirements for statistics and GIS, dedicated undergraduate coursework in computational modeling appears less prevalent. This suggests that while students gain foundational data analysis and spatial skills, exposure to advanced modeling techniques might be concentrated in specific elective courses, graduate-level studies 22, or through direct involvement in faculty research projects where such methods are employed.23

### **Supporting Academic Structures (Geospatial Sciences, Data Analytics/Science, Computing)**

UWSP possesses significant academic infrastructure in departments outside CNR that are crucial for supporting advanced computational and data-intensive approaches in natural resources.

* **Geospatial Sciences:** Housed within the Department of Geography and Geology (College of Letters and Science), this area is a major strength. It offers a B.S. in Geospatial Sciences, several GIS-related minors (Geographic Information Systems, GIS and Spatial Analysis), and a fully online GIS Professional Graduate Certificate program designed for working professionals.26 The department hosts the GIS Center, a hub for GIS education, research, and outreach.28 Coursework spans GIS fundamentals (GEOG 341/541), database design (GEOG 342/542/742), remote sensing (GEOG 377/577), advanced techniques (GEOG 743), environmental modeling (GEOG 445/645), programming/customization (GEOG 441/641), and applied statistics (GEOG 390).26 This robust structure provides essential support for spatial analysis needs across the university, including CNR.  
* **Data Analytics and Data Science:** UWSP has developed several programs in this rapidly growing field:  
  * An undergraduate **Data Analytics Minor**, administered by the Sentry School of Business and Economics (SBE), offers a structured curriculum including courses from Business (BUS), Computing (CNMT), Data Analytics (DAC/DAB), and Statistics (with options like FOR 321 or MATH 255/354/357).34  
  * A **B.S. in Data Analytics** is also offered through SBE, featuring a core sequence with courses like DAC 111 (Python Programming for Data Analytics), DAC 305 (Principles of Data and Modeling), and DAC 310 (Machine Learning and Data Mining).36  
  * An online **Data Science Graduate Certificate** (15 credits) is available through UW Extended Campus, targeting working professionals. Admission requires a bachelor's degree and prerequisites in elementary statistics, introductory programming, and databases.37 The curriculum includes core courses (Foundations, Statistical Methods, Programming) and electives such as DS 740 (Data Mining & Machine Learning) and DS 776 (Deep Learning).38  
  * A **Master of Science (M.S.) in Data Science** is administered by the Department of Computing and New Media Technologies (CNMT), likely in collaboration with UW Extended Campus, offering advanced training.39  
* **Computing and New Media Technologies (CNMT):** Located in the College of Letters and Science (School of Mathematics, Computing, Physics, and Astronomy), CNMT offers undergraduate majors in Applied Computing (an online B.S. completion program), Computer Information Systems (CIS), and Web Development, alongside various minors and certificates.40 The department lists "Artificial Intelligence" as a program area 43 and is actively recruiting faculty with expertise in AI/ML and Data Science.40 CNMT also administers the M.S. programs in Data Science and Cybersecurity.39  
* **Mathematical Sciences:** This department provides the foundational mathematics and statistics coursework essential for quantitative analysis and data science. Offerings include majors and minors in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics, with relevant courses such as MATH 255 (Elementary Statistical Methods), MATH 354 (Applied Statistics), and MATH 356/357 (Probability and Statistics I & II).34 Faculty interests encompass statistics, probability, and modeling.49

### **Advanced AI, Machine Learning, and HPC Coursework Availability**

Specific coursework focusing on AI, Machine Learning (ML), and High-Performance Computing (HPC) exists at UWSP, though primarily outside the CNR and often at the upper-division or graduate level.

* **Undergraduate AI/ML:**  
  * **DAC 310 \- Machine Learning and Data Mining (4 Cr):** This course is a core component of the B.S. in Data Analytics offered by the Sentry School of Business and Economics.36 Based on program checklists and related course syllabi, prerequisites likely involve introductory programming (Python via DAC 111), database concepts (CIS 210), and foundational data principles (DAC 101, DAC 305/formerly DAC 205).35  
  * **CNMT 211 \- Programming for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (3 Cr):** This course title appears on a University Curriculum Committee agenda packet, suggesting its existence or proposal within the CNMT department.54 However, a formal course description and prerequisite list were not available in the reviewed catalog snippets or syllabi for *this specific title*. Other CNMT programming courses exist (e.g., CNMT 101 focusing on Python 55, CNMT 110 Object-Oriented Programming 35), and WD 211 focuses on JavaScript.56 If offered, CNMT 211 could provide foundational AI programming skills, likely requiring prior programming coursework (e.g., CNMT 110).  
  * **MSTU 354 \- Topics: Artificial Intelligence and Creativity:** A special topics course taught in Media Studies (not CNMT) focusing on generative AI applications, ethics, and history in creative fields.59 This indicates broader campus engagement with AI but is not a technical ML course.  
* **Graduate AI/ML:**  
  * The online **Data Science Graduate Certificate** and **M.S. in Data Science** (administered by CNMT/UW Extended Campus) offer specialized courses. DS 740 \- Data Mining & Machine Learning and DS 776 \- Deep Learning are available as electives or core components.37 These courses have prerequisites; for example, DS 740 requires DS 705 (Statistical Methods) and DS 710 (Programming for Data Science).38  
  * CNMT faculty position descriptions note the potential for teaching graduate-level courses in Data Science, including AI/ML topics.40  
  * A former UWSP faculty member, Nilesh Timilsina, previously taught a graduate course titled FOR 8930 \- Machine Learning in Forestry while at Clemson University, suggesting potential past interest or capability in this area at UWSP.23  
* **HPC Courses:** No undergraduate courses explicitly focused on High-Performance Computing were identified within CNMT or Mathematical Sciences based on the reviewed materials. The collaborative M.S. in Data Science program includes DS 730 \- Big Data: High Performance Computing.38

The presence of courses like DAC 310 and potentially CNMT 211 at the undergraduate level, along with graduate offerings like DS 740 and DS 776, indicates that formal instruction in AI/ML is available at UWSP. However, this instruction is concentrated within the Data Analytics program (SBE) and the Data Science graduate programs (CNMT/Extended Campus). Access to high-performance computing instruction appears limited primarily to the collaborative graduate program. For CNR students, engaging with these AI/ML courses requires navigating prerequisite pathways that often include programming (specifically Python), database management, and foundational data science principles, which are not typically part of the standard CNR core curriculum.

### **Cross-Disciplinary Access: Prerequisites and Pathways for CNR Students**

The ease with which CNR students can access quantitative and computational coursework varies significantly depending on the subject area.

* **Integrated Skills (GIS & Statistics):** Pathways for CNR students to fulfill requirements in GIS and statistics are well-established and relatively seamless. They can often choose between courses offered within CNR (e.g., FOR 321 \- Natural Resources Data Analysis, WATR 391 \- GIS Applications in Natural Resources) or equivalent courses in supporting departments (e.g., MATH 255 \- Elementary Statistical Methods, GEOG 341 \- Geographic Information Systems I).9 Remote sensing is also required in some CNR options, accessible via NRES 377 or GEOG 377\.15  
* **Intermediate Data Analytics (Minor Pathway):** The Data Analytics Minor offers a structured route for CNR students seeking broader data analysis skills beyond basic statistics and GIS.34 However, completing this minor necessitates taking a specific set of courses primarily from Business (BUS), Computing (CNMT), and Data Analytics (DAC/DAB), in addition to a statistics course (where FOR 321 is an option).34 This requires a commitment to significant coursework outside the primary CNR major, potentially impacting graduation timelines or requiring careful planning. Prerequisites exist for several minor courses, such as math for statistics options and introductory computing (CNMT 100\) for Python programming (DAC 111).34  
* **Advanced AI/ML Coursework:** Accessing specialized AI/ML courses like DAC 310 (Machine Learning and Data Mining) presents a more significant challenge for typical CNR undergraduates. The prerequisite chain likely includes introductory programming (often Python, e.g., CNMT 100/110 or DAC 111), database design (e.g., CIS 210), and foundational data principles courses (e.g., DAC 101, DAC 305/205).35 Similarly, accessing the potential CNMT 211 (Programming for AI/ML) would necessitate prerequisite programming skills.44 These prerequisites fall largely outside the standard CNR curriculum map. Without pursuing a double major, a minor like Data Analytics, or strategically selecting numerous electives, CNR students would find it difficult to meet the requirements for these advanced courses during their undergraduate tenure.  
* **Graduate Options:** Post-baccalaureate pathways offer more direct routes. The online GIS Professional Graduate Certificate 26 and the Data Science Graduate Certificate 37 are available to individuals with a bachelor's degree, though the latter requires prerequisite knowledge in statistics, programming, and databases.37

In summary, while foundational quantitative and geospatial skills are readily accessible and integrated into CNR programs, the pathway to intermediate data analytics skills requires undertaking a minor, and access to advanced AI/ML technical courses is significantly constrained by prerequisite sequences residing outside the typical CNR major structure. Graduate certificates provide an alternative, post-baccalaureate route for specialization.

## **Faculty Expertise and Research Focus**

### **Relevant Research Capacity within the College of Natural Resources**

Faculty within the College of Natural Resources possess expertise spanning the breadth of natural resource disciplines, with several individuals demonstrating research interests and activities directly relevant to quantitative analysis, modeling, and spatial technologies – foundational elements for AI and data science applications.

* **Forestry:** The college has a history of strength in quantitative forestry. Nilesh Timilsina, formerly an Associate Professor of Forest Mensuration/Biometry at UWSP (now at Clemson University), specialized in forest measurements using remote sensing, growth and yield modeling, carbon estimation, spatial analysis of ecosystem services, and applied statistics.4 His background included teaching advanced biometrics and even a course on Machine Learning in Forestry (at Clemson), indicating prior capacity or interest in these advanced methods at UWSP.23 His research involved developing allometric equations and analyzing factors affecting forest resources, often employing quantitative models.63  
* **Wildlife Ecology:** Faculty expertise includes avian ecology and conservation, sampling methods, detection probability, population analysis, and statistics. Jason Riddle, the Douglas R. Stephens Chair in Wildlife, explicitly lists "Statistics" as a research interest alongside avian ecology and management.67 He is also affiliated with the Wisconsin Center for Wildlife.68 Curriculum requirements like WLDL 311 (Quantitative Methods for Wildlife and Fisheries Research) and WLDL 353 (Analysis of Wildlife Populations) further point to quantitative approaches within the discipline.21 Other faculty interests include predator ecology, animal behavior, community ecology, and human dimensions.67  
* **Fisheries and Water Resources:** Expertise covers fisheries science, aquatic biology, hydrology, and water chemistry.9 Past projects, such as the Shawano Lake watershed assessment, involved collaboration with faculty (e.g., Paul McGinley) providing direction on data analysis and computer modeling.72 The affiliated Center for Watershed Science and Education actively engages in water quality monitoring, data collection, analysis, and modeling to support watershed stewardship.4 The Wisconsin Cooperative Fishery Research Unit also contributes to research capacity 4, and the college previously housed a Molecular Conservation Genetics Laboratory.80  
* **Environment & Society / Human Dimensions:** This area includes faculty focused on the intersection of social systems and natural resources. Shiba Kar specializes in human dimensions, sustainable energy policy, climate adaptation modeling, and socioeconomic analysis, holding a joint appointment with UW-Extension.4 Anna Haines focuses on land use planning and policy, forest fragmentation, landowner attitudes, and sustainability, utilizing spatial analysis and potentially modeling in her research.4 She is affiliated with the Center for Land Use Education.4 Aaron Thompson's expertise lies in conservation planning.4  
* **Soil and Waste Resources:** Faculty expertise exists in soil science and waste management.4 Curriculum involves soil analysis, nutrient management planning, and potentially modeling related to environmental microbiology or the fate of chemicals in the environment.18 Research examples include analysis of soil properties under managed grazing.86

While explicit AI/ML research is not highlighted for current CNR faculty in the provided materials, the presence of strong quantitative skills in biometry, statistics, spatial analysis, population dynamics, and environmental/socioeconomic modeling within several disciplines provides a crucial foundation. This existing expertise in handling and interpreting complex environmental data represents a significant asset for potentially integrating more advanced AI and data science methodologies into CNR research programs.

### **Expertise in Supporting Departments (Geography/Geology, CNMT, Mathematical Sciences)**

The capacity for advanced computational work at UWSP is significantly bolstered by expertise residing in departments outside of CNR.

* **Geography and Geology:** This department is central to UWSP's geospatial capabilities. Faculty (including S. Kaplan, E. Larsen, D. Miskowiak, I. Odogba, L. Siewert) possess expertise in GIS, remote sensing, spatial analysis, cartography, environmental geography, urban planning, geodesign, and sustainability.27 Doug Miskowiak, as chair and director of the GIS Center and GIS certificate programs, plays a key role in applied GIS research and education.25 The department and its affiliated GIS Center emphasize spatial problem-solving and data analysis, providing critical support for any natural resource applications involving geographic data.28  
* **Computing and New Media Technologies (CNMT):** This department is actively building capacity in AI and Data Science. Faculty hiring initiatives specifically target expertise in Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML), Data Science, data management, and data mining.40 Tomi Heimonen, the department chair, researches Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), user experience, and information visualization, areas relevant for developing effective interfaces for complex data analysis and communicating results.43 The department administers the M.S. in Data Science and M.S. in Cybersecurity programs and offers undergraduate programs designed to produce skilled technology professionals.39  
* **Mathematical Sciences:** This department provides the essential mathematical and statistical foundation for data science and computational modeling. Faculty interests include probability, statistics, stochastic processes, operations research, and actuarial mathematics.49 The department offers core courses like Calculus, Linear Algebra, Probability, and various levels of Statistics (e.g., MATH 255, 354, 356, 357\) that are prerequisites or components of data-intensive programs like the Data Analytics major/minor.34

It is evident that the core technical expertise required for developing and applying advanced AI/ML algorithms, managing large datasets, and understanding the theoretical underpinnings of data science resides primarily within these supporting departments (CNMT, Geography/Geology, Mathematical Sciences, and SBE's Data Analytics area), rather than within CNR itself, based on the faculty profiles and program descriptions reviewed. Therefore, successful integration of AI/ML into natural resource research and education at UWSP will necessitate strong interdisciplinary collaboration, bridging the domain expertise of CNR with the technical capabilities housed elsewhere on campus.

### **Profiles of Key Researchers and Relevant Projects**

## **Research Infrastructure and Computational Resources**

### **Local UWSP Computing Environment and Software**

The local computing environment at UWSP provides foundational support for general academic and research activities, particularly in areas like GIS, but appears limited in terms of dedicated resources for high-end computational research like AI/ML.

* **General IT Infrastructure and Support:** UWSP's Information Technology (InfoTech) department manages the campus network, servers, standard hardware and software, computer labs, and provides user support through a central IT Service Desk.98 Services include account management, email, file storage options (e.g., OneDrive), and equipment loans.98  
* **Standard Software:** Campus computers are equipped with standard operating systems (Windows 11, macOS) and software suites like Microsoft Office 365\.101 Collaboration tools such as Microsoft Teams and Zoom are widely available.101 LinkedIn Learning provides access to online tutorials.101  
* **Specialized Software:**  
  * **GIS:** ESRI ArcGIS Pro is a key offering, provided to UWSP students and faculty, reflecting the strong emphasis on geospatial science. Licenses for other ESRI products are also available, and GIS data is accessible via a dedicated CNR Data Server.101  
  * **Statistics/Programming:** While specific statistical packages like SPSS or SAS are not explicitly listed as centrally provided in the reviewed software catalog 101, the requirement for statistics courses across CNR 9 implies access to necessary tools. R and Python, crucial for data science, are likely installable on individual machines or accessible via computer labs, given their use in courses like DAC 111 (Python) 34 and the availability of RStudio Server via UWEC's HPC.102  
  * **AI/ML Frameworks:** The UWSP software catalog snippets do not list major AI/ML frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch as part of the standard campus load or easily installable licensed software.101 Researchers needing these tools likely rely on individual installations, virtual environments, or external HPC resources.  
* **Laboratory Facilities:** CNR possesses specialized facilities, including a former Molecular Conservation Genetics Laboratory 80 and potentially computer labs like the CNR Advanced Computer Lab (ACL) mentioned in one source.4 The Geography and Geology department maintains computer labs equipped for GIS and mapping.28 CNMT has labs focused on areas like Digital Forensics and Information Assurance.43 However, there is no mention in the provided documentation of dedicated, centrally managed High-Performance Computing (HPC) clusters or labs with significant GPU capabilities located physically at UWSP and managed by InfoTech.

The available information suggests that UWSP's local IT infrastructure adequately supports standard academic computing needs and foundational quantitative work, especially GIS. However, it lacks the dedicated, high-end computational resources (local HPC, readily accessible GPUs, pre-configured AI/ML environments) typically required for cutting-edge research in computationally intensive fields like AI and large-scale modeling. This contrasts with the detailed descriptions of such resources available at larger UW System campuses.103

### **High-Performance Computing (HPC), GPU Access, and AI/ML Software Stacks (Leveraging UW System Resources)**

UWSP researchers and students requiring advanced computational power beyond local capabilities appear to rely significantly on shared resources within the University of Wisconsin System.

* **Key UW System Resources:**  
  * **Blugold Center for High Performance Computing (UW-Eau Claire):** This center operates significant HPC clusters (BOSE and BGSC) built in collaboration with Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE).104 Crucially, the user policy explicitly states that faculty, staff, and students from other UW campuses, including UWSP, can request access.107 Access typically requires contacting the administrators (BGSC.ADMINS@uwec.edu), outlining the project needs, and obtaining UWEC login credentials.107 While access may involve service fees for non-UW System users, collaborations involving UWEC personnel or outreach activities may qualify for waivers.107 The Blugold Center provides nodes equipped with GPUs, accessible via dedicated Slurm partitions (e.g., GPU partition on BOSE).107 The software environment utilizes a module system and supports common research tools including Python, R, and Conda for managing software environments.102 This allows users to set up environments with packages like TensorFlow.110  
  * **UW-Madison Resources:** UW-Madison possesses extensive research computing infrastructure, notably the Center for High Throughput Computing (CHTC), which offers tens of thousands of CPU cores, hundreds of GPUs, and specialized support for large-scale computation.108 They also provide large-scale storage (ResearchDrive) and data management services.108 While specific access policies for other UW campuses like UWSP are not detailed in the provided snippets, system-wide collaborations and resource sharing are common within the UW System.  
  * **UW-IT (Seattle \- UW System context unclear):** Although primarily serving UW Seattle, UW-IT operates the Hyak supercomputer (with significant GPU resources), Lolo storage services, and provides cloud computing consultations.103 Potential exists for UWSP researchers to leverage cloud credits or participate in broader initiatives if system-wide agreements are in place.106  
* **GPU Availability:** Access to GPUs, essential for accelerating many AI/ML workloads 62, is primarily facilitated through these shared UW System resources, particularly the Blugold Center 107 and CHTC.108  
* **AI/ML Software Stacks:** The necessary software ecosystem for AI/ML research is accessible via these shared HPC environments.  
  * **Python and R:** These foundational data science languages are available as standard modules or can be managed using Conda environments on platforms like the Blugold HPC.102 UWSP courses also utilize Python.34  
  * **TensorFlow and PyTorch:** These leading deep learning frameworks are not typically pre-installed system-wide but can be readily installed and managed within user-specific Conda environments on the Blugold HPC clusters.102 Documentation and examples exist to guide users through setting up these frameworks, including configuring them for GPU utilization.110 These tools are industry standards for AI development.62

The evidence strongly suggests that UWSP's strategy for providing access to advanced computational resources hinges on leveraging the shared infrastructure established within the UW System, most notably the Blugold Center at UW-Eau Claire. This reliance necessitates that UWSP researchers and students become proficient in navigating the access policies and technical environments of these external partner facilities.

### **Access Policies and Support for Researchers and Students**

Navigating the available computational resources involves understanding access policies and identifying appropriate support channels.

* **Accessing Shared HPC (Blugold Example):** Gaining access to the Blugold Center at UWEC requires a formal request outlining research needs. Approved users receive UWEC credentials and must complete mandatory user training before gaining full cluster access.107 Users are expected to acknowledge the HPC resource in publications resulting from its use and are responsible for backing up their own data.107 Off-campus access requires using the UWEC VPN.109  
* **Local UWSP Support:**  
  * **IT Service Desk:** Serves as the primary point of contact for general technology issues, campus device support, standard software installation, computer lab reservations, and equipment loans.99 Their focus is on maintaining the standard campus computing environment.101  
  * **Office of Research and Sponsored Programs (ORSP):** Provides crucial support for the administrative aspects of research, including identifying funding opportunities, assisting with grant proposal submission (using the WISPER system), and ensuring compliance with regulations related to RCR, IRB (human subjects), and IBC (biosafety).116 They connect researchers with resources like WiSys for grant writing assistance.116  
* **Specialized Computational Research Support:** Based on the reviewed materials, there is a potential gap in dedicated, local support staff at UWSP specializing in advanced research computing facilitation. While UWSP InfoTech handles general IT needs and ORSP manages grant administration and compliance, there is no mention of roles akin to the Research Computing Facilitators, Data Scientists, or Statistical Consultants described at UW-Madison 108 or UW-IT Seattle 103 whose primary function is to assist researchers with complex computational methods, code optimization, HPC usage, or AI/ML implementation. UWSP researchers needing such specialized assistance may need to rely on their own expertise, collaborations within their department or other departments (like CNMT or Math), or the support provided by the staff at the host HPC facility (e.g., the BGSC.ADMINS team at UWEC 107). This lack of local, specialized computational support could present a barrier for researchers venturing into more complex data science or AI projects.

## **Strategic Alignment and Initiatives**

### **Institutional Strategic Priorities (UWSP Strategic Plan) regarding AI, Data Science, and Computational Research**

The University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point's formal strategic plan for the 2020/2021-2025 period, titled "Purpose Made Possible: Determination to Lead the Way," outlines the institution's vision and goals. The plan centers around four major themes: Aligning Financial Model with Institutional Vision, Expanding Educational Opportunities for Student Success, Enhancing the Student Experience, and Serving our Internal and External Communities for Impact.119 Chancellor Gibson further emphasized three strategic imperatives: academic excellence, inclusive excellence, and enrollment and growth.119

Based on the provided excerpts from the official strategic plan document and associated summary pages 119, there is no explicit mention of "Artificial Intelligence," "Data Science," or "Computational Research" as distinct, high-level strategic priorities or goals for the university within these core themes or imperatives. The plan's language focuses on broader objectives related to student success, community engagement, financial sustainability, and overall academic and inclusive excellence.119

Despite the apparent absence from the top-level strategic plan narrative found in the snippets, UWSP demonstrates engagement with AI and data science through various activities across campus. Continuing Education offers AI-focused courses and events targeting business and industry needs.123 The Department of Computing and New Media Technologies (CNMT) is actively recruiting faculty with AI/ML expertise and administers graduate programs in Data Science and Cybersecurity.40 Specialized courses exploring AI exist, such as the Media Studies topic course on AI and Creativity.59 Furthermore, UWSP participates in broader UW System discussions and initiatives related to AI and data science, as evidenced by system-level reports and program developments at sister institutions like UW-Stout, UW-Milwaukee, and UW-Eau Claire.50

This suggests that while AI and data science are areas of growing activity and interest within specific departments and in response to external trends, they have not (based on the available plan excerpts) been elevated to the level of explicitly stated, university-wide strategic priorities within the current "Purpose Made Possible" framework. The focus of the formal plan appears to remain on more traditional pillars of university operations and mission fulfillment.

### **College of Natural Resources Mission and Strategic Integration**

The mission and vision statements for the College of Natural Resources (CNR) emphasize its long-standing strengths in conservation, hands-on learning, and preparing students for leadership roles in environmental fields. The overarching goal is articulated as "creating tomorrow's conservation leaders through innovative, hands-on learning," driven by an interdisciplinary approach and immersive field experiences.5 The College aims to empower students in environmental stewardship, sustainability, and resource management, guided by values of integrity, innovation, and collaboration.5 The Forestry program's mission, for example, focuses on developing "ethical, employable forestry professionals with the expertise to manage resources sustainably" through "interdisciplinary, application-based educational programs".7

However, within the provided mission statements and strategic descriptions for the CNR as a whole 4 and its specific disciplines like Forestry 7, Wildlife Ecology 10, Fisheries and Water Resources 71, and Soil and Waste Resources 127, there is a notable absence of explicit references to Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, or advanced computational modeling as core strategic elements. The language consistently highlights traditional strengths: field skills, ecological understanding, specific resource management techniques (e.g., forest management, wildlife conservation, water preservation), and preparing students for established careers in the environmental sector.

This lack of explicit mention suggests that, at the strategic level articulated in these documents, the integration of cutting-edge computational science has not yet been formally incorporated into the CNR's core identity or future direction. While individual faculty members may utilize advanced methods in their research 23 and some quantitative courses exist, the overarching strategic narrative for the College continues to emphasize its established foundation in field-based, applied natural resource science and management.

### **Relevant Research Centers, Field Stations, and Collaborative Projects**

UWSP and its CNR benefit from a network of field stations and specialized centers that support education, research, and outreach, forming a significant part of its infrastructure.

* **Field Stations:** Treehaven, Schmeeckle Reserve, and the Central Wisconsin Environmental Station (CWES) serve as vital hubs for hands-on learning, summer field courses required by many CNR majors, and potentially long-term ecological data collection.4  
* **CNR-Affiliated Centers:** Several centers operate within or in close collaboration with CNR, extending its reach and research capabilities:  
  * **Center for Land Use Education (CLUE):** Focuses on land use planning, policy, watershed management, and community engagement, often involving spatial analysis and modeling (associated with Prof. Haines).4  
  * **Center for Watershed Science and Education (CWSE):** Engages in water quality monitoring, assessment, research, and modeling (e.g., groundwater modeling workshops, Shawano Lake phosphorus study).4  
  * **Wisconsin Center for Wildlife (WCW):** Concentrates on wildlife conservation research and outreach (associated with Prof. Riddle).5 Research activities involve population analysis and sampling methods.129  
  * **Other CNR Centers:** Include the Wisconsin Center for Environmental Education (WCEE) 5, Wisconsin Cooperative Fishery Research Unit 4, Wisconsin Forestry Center 5, Water and Environmental Analysis Lab (WEAL) 4, Aquatic Biomonitoring Laboratory (ABL) 4, and Wisconsin Institute for Sustainable Technology (WIST).4  
* **Other Relevant Centers:**  
  * **GIS Center (Geography/Geology):** A key campus resource for GIS training, research, and applied projects, collaborating across departments (e.g., Wisconsin Waterways App with CNMT).28 Reviewed project descriptions focus on GIS applications and spatial analysis, without explicit mention of AI/ML.2  
  * **Center for the Small City (Geography/Geology):** Focuses on issues relevant to smaller municipalities.28  
  * **Center for Cybersecurity Studies and Advanced Research (CNMT):** Addresses cybersecurity and digital forensics.43  
* **Externally Funded Projects:** Specific examples of large, externally funded projects integrating AI/Data Science with natural resources at UWSP were limited in the provided materials. The university secured $6.89 million in new research grants in FY24, primarily benefiting CNR and the College of Letters and Science.95 One highlighted project involves a UW System Innovation Grant for phytoremediation research.95 While national funding agencies like NSF and USDA have major initiatives supporting AI in agriculture and environmental science 1, no specific awards under these programs directly to UWSP for AI in natural resources were identified in the reviewed snippets.1

While UWSP possesses a strong network of centers relevant to natural resources and geospatial science, providing valuable infrastructure for research, education, and outreach, the documented activities of these centers primarily emphasize traditional field methods, monitoring, domain-specific modeling (e.g., watershed hydrology, land use change), and GIS applications. There is limited evidence in the reviewed materials of these centers undertaking major initiatives explicitly leveraging advanced AI, machine learning, or large-scale data science approaches, even though the data they collect and the problems they address could potentially benefit from such methods.

## **Ethical Considerations and Research Conduct**

### **Institutional Policies on AI in Academic Work**

UWSP has established institutional policies and guidelines to address the use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) in the academic environment, acknowledging both its potential and challenges.

* **University Handbook Policy:** Chapter 5 of the UWSP Faculty/Staff Handbook contains the official policy on "AI Classroom Usage".135 This policy recognizes the importance of preparing students for workplaces where AI tools are prevalent but establishes a default restriction: the use of GAI for completing graded (summative) coursework is prohibited *unless explicitly permitted* by the course instructor.135 This approach aims to protect academic integrity while allowing for pedagogical innovation.  
* **Delegation to Academic Units:** The university policy mandates that individual academic units (departments, schools, colleges) develop their own specific policies regarding AI use.135 These unit-level policies must clearly define the types of AI tools allowed, the specific purposes for which they can be used, and the required methods for acknowledging AI assistance. The goal is to balance the development of AI literacy with the mastery of core disciplinary competencies (e.g., critical thinking, communication).135  
* **Syllabus Requirement:** Instructors are required to include their specific GAI policies in course syllabi and discuss these expectations with students.135 This ensures transparency, as policies may vary significantly between courses and disciplines. An example syllabus from Philosophy (PHIL 101\) demonstrates a strict prohibition policy.138  
* **Faculty Support:** The Center for Inclusive Teaching and Learning (CITL) provides resources, guidance, and consultations for faculty grappling with AI integration, policy development, and assignment redesign.136  
* **Broader Context:** These policies align with emerging best practices across higher education and the UW System, which emphasize ethical considerations, data privacy (particularly cautioning against inputting sensitive or proprietary information into public AI tools), the need to verify AI output for accuracy and bias, and transparency in AI use.139

UWSP has implemented a foundational policy framework for managing GAI use in academic work. By setting a default restriction but allowing instructor discretion and delegating detailed policy development to academic units, the university aims to provide flexibility while upholding academic standards. The effectiveness of this approach depends on the consistent development, clear communication, and fair application of these policies at the course and program levels.

### **Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) and CITI Training Mandates**

UWSP maintains standard protocols for ensuring the ethical conduct of research, primarily through mandated training via the CITI Program.

* **RCR Training Requirement:** Training in Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) is mandatory for principal investigators and their research staff (including students) involved in most federally funded grant projects.117 This aligns with federal funding agency requirements (e.g., NSF, NIH).141  
* **CITI Program Implementation:** UWSP utilizes the widely adopted CITI Program platform to deliver RCR training.117 CITI offers comprehensive modules covering core ethical principles and regulations relevant to research, such as authorship practices, data management and sharing, conflict of interest, research misconduct, and specific considerations for research involving human subjects or animals.141  
* **UWSP-Specific CITI Requirements:** All researchers involved in projects requiring Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval must complete CITI training before approval is granted. This training is valid for three years, after which a refresher course is needed.118 The specific CITI courses required depend on the nature of the research:  
  * *Human Subjects Research Course:* For behavioral/social science research involving surveys, interactions, etc..118  
  * *Biomedical Research Course:* For clinical or biomedical studies.118  
  * *Information Security & Privacy Course:* Required for all researchers accessing Private Identifiable Information (PII) or Protected Health Information (PHI).118  
  * *FERPA for Researchers Course:* Required for those working with identifiable student data.118  
* **Oversight Bodies:** Research activities are overseen by the IRB for human subjects research 117 and the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) for work involving certain biological materials.117  
* **AI Ethics in RCR:** While standard RCR principles like data integrity, responsible data management, and avoiding misconduct are directly relevant to the ethical conduct of AI research, the provided documentation does not indicate that UWSP mandates specific CITI modules focused explicitly on AI ethics (e.g., algorithmic bias, model transparency, accountability in AI systems) as part of its required RCR training.117 Discussions around AI ethics appear to occur in other forums, such as faculty development workshops offered by CITL 137 or within specific courses addressing AI.59  
* **CNR Context:** Although specific CNR graduate handbooks detailing CITI requirements were not found 77, the university-wide RCR policies apply to all researchers, including those in CNR. Faculty and students conducting research involving human dimensions surveys, genetic analyses, or other relevant activities would be subject to these CITI training mandates.117

UWSP employs a standard, CITI-based framework for RCR training that covers essential ethical principles applicable across disciplines. This framework provides a necessary foundation for ethical research practices, including those involving data-intensive or computational methods. However, the unique ethical challenges posed specifically by AI and ML (such as algorithmic bias, transparency, and societal impact) do not appear to be addressed through dedicated, mandatory modules within the current required CITI training structure described in the available materials. These specific concerns might be integrated implicitly within existing modules or addressed through separate institutional policies and educational initiatives.

## **Conclusion**

The University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point possesses a strong foundation in natural resource education and research, particularly within its College of Natural Resources (CNR), which holds key accreditations and emphasizes hands-on learning. The university also demonstrates significant capabilities in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and geospatial science, supported by the Department of Geography and Geology and its GIS Center. Foundational quantitative skills, including statistics, are integrated into CNR curricula. Furthermore, UWSP benefits from access to shared High-Performance Computing (HPC) resources, including GPU capabilities and standard AI/ML software stacks, through the UW System, primarily via the Blugold Center at UW-Eau Claire. Pockets of faculty expertise in quantitative modeling, statistics, and spatial analysis exist within CNR, complemented by growing expertise in AI, ML, and data science within supporting departments like CNMT and SBE. Established policies for Responsible Conduct of Research and emerging guidelines for AI use in academics provide an ethical framework.

However, the analysis also reveals areas where capabilities related to AI and advanced computation in natural resources could be further developed. The explicit integration of advanced computational modeling, data science, and AI/ML concepts into CNR's core undergraduate curricula and its articulated strategic mission appears limited. Accessing the existing advanced AI/ML coursework, primarily housed in CNMT and SBE, presents potential prerequisite barriers for CNR students. While access to UW System HPC is crucial, the lack of evident local, centrally supported HPC/GPU resources and specialized computational research support staff at UWSP may hinder broader adoption and innovation. Additionally, AI and data science do not appear as explicit top-level priorities in the reviewed excerpts of the university's primary strategic plan or the CNR's mission statements. The activities of relevant research centers, while valuable, show limited documented application of cutting-edge AI/ML techniques in the provided materials.

Based on this assessment, the following recommendations are offered to enhance UWSP's capacity at the intersection of AI, Data Science, and Natural Resources:

1. **Enhance Curricular Integration and Accessibility:**  
   * Develop clear pathways (e.g., dedicated minors, certificates, or course concentrations bridging CNR and CNMT/Data Analytics) to make AI, ML, and data science coursework more accessible to CNR students, addressing prerequisite barriers.  
   * Integrate computational modeling, data science principles, and case studies involving AI/ML more explicitly into existing and new CNR courses at both undergraduate and graduate levels.  
   * Explore workshops or short courses co-taught by CNR and CNMT/Math/Geography faculty focused on AI/ML applications in specific natural resource domains.  
2. **Strengthen Research Infrastructure and Support:**  
   * Assess the feasibility of investing in modest, local computational resources accessible to CNR researchers and students (e.g., dedicated GPU workstations or a small departmental cluster) to lower the barrier for initial exploration and smaller-scale projects.  
   * Develop or enhance local support roles (potentially within InfoTech, ORSP, or CNR) specializing in research computing facilitation, data science consultation, and AI/ML programming assistance to aid researchers in utilizing local and UW System resources effectively.  
   * Promote awareness and streamline access procedures for utilizing UW System HPC resources like the Blugold Center.  
3. **Foster Interdisciplinary Collaboration and Expertise:**  
   * Actively incentivize and facilitate collaborative research projects and grant proposals between CNR faculty and faculty in CNMT, Mathematical Sciences, Geography/Geology, and Data Analytics.  
   * Consider strategic hires within CNR that explicitly include expertise in computational ecology, environmental data science, or AI/ML applications in natural resources.  
   * Support professional development opportunities for existing CNR faculty interested in incorporating advanced computational methods into their teaching and research.  
4. **Align Strategic Planning:**  
   * Explicitly incorporate the role of data science, AI, and advanced computation in addressing natural resource challenges into future iterations of the CNR's strategic plan and mission statement.  
   * Consider elevating data literacy and computational thinking as key institutional priorities within future university-wide strategic planning efforts, reflecting their growing importance across disciplines.  
5. **Leverage Existing Centers:**  
   * Encourage existing centers (e.g., GIS Center, CWSE, WCW, CLUE) to explore and pilot projects that apply AI/ML techniques to their respective domains, potentially through seed funding or collaborative initiatives.  
   * Showcase successful applications of computational methods (including AI/ML) at the annual CNR Student Research Symposium and other forums.

By strategically addressing these areas, UWSP can build upon its existing strengths in natural resources and geospatial science to become a stronger contributor in the application of AI and advanced computational methods to environmental challenges, further enhancing the education of its students and the impact of its research.
