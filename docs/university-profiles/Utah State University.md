### **A. Overview of the S.J. & Jessie E. Quinney College of Natural Resources (QCNR)**

Utah State University (USU) positions the S.J. & Jessie E. Quinney College of Natural Resources (QCNR) as its primary academic unit dedicated to the study and stewardship of natural ecosystems. The college's mission centers on utilizing teaching, research, and extension programs to deepen the understanding of these systems and promote their sustainable use.1 This mission explicitly includes advancing scientific knowledge, training future leaders in research and management, and, critically, translating research findings into practical management applications.1 This emphasis on application suggests a strong potential alignment with computational tools, which excel at processing complex data to generate actionable insights for resource management.

QCNR holds significant standing, being nationally and internationally recognized for its research contributions concerning natural and socio-environmental ecosystems.2 Annually, the college secures over $15 million in research funding and supports 55 tenure-track faculty members across its departments.2 This substantial research activity and funding base imply a capacity within the college to support and leverage advanced analytical methods and potentially invest in the necessary computational resources and specialized expertise required for modern, data-intensive natural resource science. Key leadership figures include Dean Linda Nagel and Associate Dean for Academics Peter Howe.4

### **B. Relevant Colleges, Schools, and Departments**

QCNR is structured into three core departments, each addressing distinct but interconnected facets of natural resource science and management 1:

1. **Department of Wildland Resources (WILD):** This department concentrates on applied terrestrial ecology. Its scope encompasses the ecology and management of forests, rangelands, and wildlife, as well as conservation biology and climate change adaptation.2 This department is central to traditional areas like forestry and wildlife management.  
2. **Department of Environment and Society (ENVS):** ENVS programs emphasize the human dimensions of environmental issues, including management, policy, geography, and socio-environmental interactions.4 This department is particularly relevant for Geographic Information Science (GIS), socio-ecological modeling, and understanding the policy context of resource management.  
3. **Department of Watershed Sciences (WATS):** WATS focuses on aquatic systems, offering programs in fisheries, aquatic ecology, hydrology, water quality, and the management and restoration of aquatic ecosystems.7 This department engages heavily with the physical and biological processes governing water resources.

This departmental structure, covering terrestrial, aquatic, and human dimensions, naturally fosters interdisciplinary approaches. Complex environmental challenges, such as climate change impacts across landscapes, necessitate integrating knowledge from these domains. Computational tools like data science, GIS, and modeling are particularly well-suited for synthesizing diverse data streams and analyzing interactions across these departmental disciplines, suggesting a fertile ground within QCNR for applying such methods.

### **C. Undergraduate and Graduate Degree Programs in Forestry, Conservation, Environmental Science, and Natural Resources**

## **Accreditation Status of Key QCNR Programs**

Professional accreditation serves as an external validation of program quality and adherence to standards set by disciplinary bodies. Within QCNR, several programs hold accreditation from relevant societies.

### **A. Society of American Foresters (SAF)**

The BS program in Forest Ecology and Management, housed within the Department of Wildland Resources, is nationally accredited by the Society of American Foresters (SAF).14 This accreditation is significant as it positions USU's program as the only SAF-accredited 4-year forestry degree in Utah. The program has maintained this accreditation continuously since 1936\.15 SAF is the recognized accrediting body for postsecondary programs in forestry, urban forestry, natural resources and ecosystem management, and forest technology in the United States.16 The longevity of USU's SAF accreditation suggests a robust program that has consistently adapted to evolving professional standards over many decades. Given the increasing reliance on quantitative and geospatial tools in modern forestry, it is highly probable that the curriculum incorporates these elements sufficiently to meet current SAF criteria. A comprehensive list of all SAF-accredited programs nationally is typically available via the SAF website, often in downloadable formats.16

### **B. Society for Range Management (SRM)**

The BS program in Rangeland Ecology and Management, also within the Department of Wildland Resources, is nationally accredited by the Society for Range Management (SRM).18 USU is explicitly listed among universities holding SRM accreditation.19 Various university documents and job postings confirm this status.2 SRM accreditation signifies that the program meets established minimum standards for professional education in range management.19 The fact that the Department of Wildland Resources successfully maintains accreditation from both SAF (for Forestry) and SRM (for Rangeland Ecology) points to a departmental commitment to rigorous external standards across related disciplines.2 This dual focus could potentially foster synergies in curriculum or faculty expertise, particularly in shared methodological areas like quantitative analysis or geospatial technology, which are increasingly relevant to both fields.

### **C. The Wildlife Society (TWS)**

The Wildlife Society (TWS) operates differently from SAF and SRM regarding program-level recognition. TWS primarily offers *individual certification* for professionals, designating qualified individuals as Associate Wildlife Biologists® (AWB®) or Certified Wildlife Biologists® (CWB®) based on meeting specific educational and experience standards.22 TWS does *not* offer programmatic accreditation for university wildlife degree programs.24 While TWS maintains a list of North American institutions offering wildlife-related curricula, it explicitly states this list is not an endorsement or accreditation.24 Utah State University does host an active TWS student chapter, indicating student engagement with the professional society.25

Therefore, USU's BS in Wildlife Ecology and Management program is not "TWS accredited." However, the program's curriculum is likely designed to align with the educational requirements necessary for graduates to pursue individual TWS certification.22 The absence of programmatic accreditation places the responsibility on the university curriculum to ensure students acquire the coursework TWS mandates for certification, which typically includes quantitative science, ecology, policy, and specific biological subjects.27 The existence of the student chapter suggests an institutional awareness of and orientation towards these professional standards.25

Table 2 summarizes the accreditation status for these key QCNR programs.

**Table 2: Accreditation Status of Key QCNR Programs**

| Program Name | Department | Accrediting Body | Accreditation Status/Details |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Forest Ecology and Management (BS) | Wildland Resources | Society of American Foresters (SAF) | Accredited (Forestry Standard). Continuous accreditation since 1936\. Only accredited 4-year forestry program in Utah. 14 |
| Rangeland Ecology and Management (BS) | Wildland Resources | Society for Range Management (SRM) | Accredited. USU listed as an SRM-accredited university. Only accredited Rangeland program in Utah. 2 |
| Wildlife Ecology and Management (BS) | Wildland Resources | The Wildlife Society (TWS) | Not Applicable (TWS offers individual certification, not programmatic accreditation). Curriculum likely aligned with TWS certification requirements. Active TWS student chapter at USU. 24 |

Advanced modeling or AI/ML courses are not typically core requirements but may be available as electives or through minors/certificates.  
* **Rangeland Ecology and Management (BS):** This program requires foundational math and statistics (MATH 1050, MATH 1100, STAT 2000 or STAT 3000\) and introductory GIS (WILD 2800 or GEOG 2800). It also includes courses involving quantitative techniques like WILD 2400 (Wildland Resource Techniques) and WILD 4750 (Monitoring and Assessment in Natural Resource and Environmental Management), alongside resource economics (APEC 3012\) and policy (ENVS 3010).18  
* **Wildlife Ecology and Management (BS):** Core requirements include foundational biology, ecology, math, and statistics (e.g., STAT 2000/3000).31 Courses emphasize measuring and managing vegetation and understanding plant and animal ecology. While GIS or advanced modeling are not explicitly listed as required core courses in available descriptions, the Department of Wildland Resources hosts the USU RS/GIS Lab, suggesting access and potential integration.9 Quantitative population analysis and habitat modeling are standard tools in this field.  
* **Conservation and Restoration Ecology (BS):** This curriculum mandates foundational statistics (STAT 2000 or STAT 3000\) and introductory GIS (WILD 2800 or GEOG 2800). It also requires WILD 2400 (Wildland Resource Techniques) and WILD 4750 (Monitoring and Assessment), indicating training in quantitative field methods and data analysis.33 The program aims for a broad interdisciplinary approach to analysis and management.35  
* **Environmental Studies (BS):** This program requires ENVS 3500 (Environmental Data Science QI) and introductory GIS (GEOG 2800 or WILD 2800). Elective options include ENVS 5100 (Introduction to Modeling Human-Environment Systems), demonstrating opportunities for more advanced quantitative work.36  
* **Environmental Science and Sustainability (BS):** Similar to Environmental Studies, this major requires foundational statistics (options including STAT 3080 \- Data Science for Scientists), introductory GIS (GEOG 2800 or WILD 2800), and ENVS 3500 (Environmental Data Science QI). Electives include ENVS 5100 (Modeling) and GEOG 3800 (Geospatial Data Visualization).38 These ENVS programs appear to have more explicit data science integration in their core compared to WILD programs.  
* **Geography (BS \- GIS Emphasis):** This emphasis provides focused training in geospatial technologies. While specific USU course lists were limited in the snippets, program descriptions highlight proficiency in GIS, remote sensing, spatial analysis, cartography, and quantitative analysis.40 Courses listed under the related Applied GIS and GeoAI certificates (often cross-listed GEOG/NR) provide strong examples: GEOG 2800 (Intro GIS), GEOG 5500 (Advanced GIS), GEOG 3700 (Python Programming for GIS), GEOG 5300 (Geospatial Analysis with R), GEOG 5805/NR 6805 (Introduction to GeoAI), GEOG/NR 6855 (Advanced GeoAI).41  
* **Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences (BS):** The curriculum mandates a solid foundation in math, statistics, biology, chemistry, and ecology.44 While advanced computational courses are not core requirements, the potential career path of "GIS Technician/Geospatial Analyst" 44 and the department's offering of a GIS minor suggest avenues for specialization.  
* **Management and Restoration of Aquatic Ecosystems (BS):** This program integrates physics, chemistry, and biology.45 Similar to Fisheries, direct requirements for advanced computational courses are limited, but GIS/Geospatial Analyst is a listed career outcome.45 The availability of relevant graduate-level courses within the department or college (e.g., NR 6910 GIS, NR 6940 Remote Sensing, NR 6950 Geospatial Analysis, often taken by MNR students) indicates faculty expertise and potential elective opportunities.47  
* **QCNR Graduate Programs:** Graduate studies across QCNR departments incorporate quantitative and computational methods more significantly. The Wildland Resources department points students toward "USU-wide Quantitative Courses".12 The interdepartmental Ecology MS/PhD program includes a "Quantitative Ecology" block.49 The ENVS PhD mandates methods/analysis coursework.50 Watershed Sciences emphasizes analysis and modeling, particularly evident in the affiliated Watershed & Wildfires Research Collaborative which utilizes data science and machine learning.8 The MNR program offers a suite of courses in GIS, remote sensing, Python, R for data management, and species distribution modeling.47

Across QCNR undergraduate programs, foundational courses in statistics (STAT 2000/3000) and introductory GIS (WILD 2800/GEOG 2800\) are common threads. However, dedicated courses in advanced data science, artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML), or complex computational modeling are less frequently found as *required* components of the core undergraduate curricula. These advanced topics appear more consistently at the graduate level, within specialized minors or certificates, or as electives, suggesting a tiered approach to computational skill development within the college.

### **B. Related Specializations, Minors, and Certificate Programs**

QCNR and affiliated departments offer several specialized programs that allow students to deepen their computational and data-analytic skills:

* **Geographic Information Science (GIS) / Geospatial AI:**

Core courses include NR 6805 (Intro to GeoAI), NR 6815 (Drone Data Processing), NR 6825 (GeoAI Ethics & Society), NR 6835 (Geovisualization for Remote Sensing), and NR 6855 (Advanced GeoAI). Electives cover Python for GIS, advanced remote sensing, and geospatial analysis. A capstone project (NR 6890\) is required.41  
  * *GIS Minor (Watershed Sciences):* Provides a focused track in geospatial skills for students in aquatic sciences.7  
  * *GIS Certificate (Graduate \- Online):* A 4-course graduate certificate focusing on applying GIS and remote sensing to natural resource issues, available as standalone or complementary to a degree.52 Coursework likely overlaps with MNR offerings like NR 6910, 6930, 6940, 6950\.  
* **Other Relevant Minors/Certificates:**  
  * Within QCNR, minors are also available in Environmental Studies, Fisheries Science, Geography, Geography Teaching, Marine Science, Recreation Resource Management, Sustainable Systems, Watershed Science, and Wildlife Science.4 While not purely computational, these often involve data analysis relevant to their field.  
  * The Department of Environment and Society also offers certificates in Climate Change Solutions.7

The Department of Environment and Society, through its Geography program and the specialized certificates in Applied GIS and particularly Remote Sensing and Geospatial AI, emerges as a significant hub within QCNR for advancing geospatial AI and data science applications in natural resources.7 The comprehensive structure of the GeoAI certificate, especially the graduate version with its dedicated courses on advanced GeoAI (NR 6855\) and ethics (NR 6825), signals a robust and forward-looking approach to this specialization.41 The inclusion of an ethics component is particularly noteworthy, addressing the critical need for responsible development and deployment of these technologies.

Furthermore, offering GIS and GeoAI certificates at both undergraduate and graduate/post-bachelor levels, including online options, reflects a strategy to accommodate diverse student needs and career trajectories.41 This approach broadens access to specialized training for current undergraduates seeking complementary skills and for working professionals aiming to upskill or transition careers.

These represent potential opportunities for QCNR students seeking deeper specialization.

### **A. Advanced AI, ML, HPC, Data Science/Analytics Courses in Other Departments**

Several departments offer advanced coursework relevant to AI, machine learning, high-performance computing (HPC), and data science:

* **Department of Data Analytics & Information Systems (DAIS) (Jon M. Huntsman School of Business):** Offers courses such as DATA 5600 (Intro to Regression and Machine Learning), DATA 5610/6610 (Deep Learning), DATA 5420/6420 (Text Mining), DATA 5630/6630 (Deep Forecasting), and DATA 5570/6570 (Building Software with AI).41  
* **Department of Mathematics & Statistics (College of Science):** Provides courses like STAT 5100 (Modern Regression Methods), STAT 5645/6645 (Mathematical Methods for Data Science), STAT 5650 (Statistical Learning and Data Mining I / Applied Machine Learning and Multivariate Statistics), STAT 5685/6685 (Deep Learning Theory and Applications), and STAT 6655 (Machine Learning).41

This diverse array of courses signifies substantial university-wide expertise and instructional capacity in advanced computational fields. The presence of numerous AI/ML and data science courses creates a rich environment for potential interdisciplinary learning for QCNR students, contingent upon prerequisite fulfillment and perceived relevance to natural resource applications.

### **B. Evaluation of Prerequisites and Accessibility for QCNR Students**

While the availability of advanced courses is a strength, their accessibility to students outside the offering department depends heavily on prerequisites. An analysis reveals potential challenges and pathways:

* **Courses with Higher Accessibility:**  
  * DATA 5600 (Intro Regression & ML): Requires foundational statistics (STAT 2000/3000, common in QCNR) and introductory Python (DATA 3500, potentially taken concurrently).54 This course appears relatively accessible.  
  * STAT 5650 (Applied ML/Stat Learning): Builds on STAT 5100 (Modern Regression) or DATA 5600\.55 Since STAT 5100 often follows STAT 3000 57, this pathway seems feasible for QCNR students who take the foundational stats sequence.  
  * GeoAI Courses (GEOG/NR): Explicitly cross-listed and designed for an interdisciplinary audience including natural resources.41  
* **Courses with Potential Barriers:**  
  * STAT 5685/6685 (Deep Learning): Prerequisites include Calculus II (MATH 1220), Linear Algebra (MATH 2270 or equivalent), Probability (MATH 5710 or STAT 3000), and Python experience.58 Typical QCNR math sequences may only go through Calculus Techniques (MATH 1100\) 30, creating a gap in required math.  
  * CS 4320 (Applied ML): Requires foundational computer science courses (CS 1400, 1410, 2420 \- Intro CS I/II, Data Structures).59 These are substantial prerequisites typically outside QCNR curricula.  
  * CS 5640/6640 (Neural Networks): Primarily intended for CS graduate students or requires instructor permission.61  
* **Bridging Courses:**  
  * The existence of courses like STAT/MATH 5645/6645 (Mathematical Methods for Data Science) 41 and STAT 3080 (Data Science for Scientists) 36 suggests institutional efforts to create pathways for students from scientific backgrounds to gain the necessary mathematical and statistical foundations for advanced data science work. STAT 3080 is even noted as a preferred option for the Environmental Studies statistics requirement.36

Effectively, while QCNR students typically acquire foundational statistics and often introductory GIS skills within their majors, accessing the most advanced AI/ML courses, particularly those housed in Computer Science or requiring higher-level mathematics (Calculus II, Linear Algebra), necessitates proactive planning to take prerequisite courses beyond standard QCNR requirements. Courses offered by DAIS or those explicitly cross-listed with Natural Resources (NR) or Geography (GEOG), such as the GeoAI sequence, likely present more immediate pathways for QCNR students to gain specialized computational skills.

Table 4 summarizes selected advanced courses and assesses their potential accessibility.

**Table 4: Selected Advanced AI/ML/Data Science Courses at USU (Non-QCNR) and Key Prerequisites**

## **Faculty Expertise: Bridging Natural Resources with AI, Geospatial Analysis, and Quantitative Methods**

The capacity for impactful interdisciplinary research and education hinges on faculty expertise that spans traditional disciplinary boundaries. At USU, several faculty members across QCNR and collaborating departments possess research interests and projects that integrate AI/ML, geospatial analysis, computational modeling, or advanced quantitative methods with applications in forestry, conservation, environmental science, and natural resources.

* **Within QCNR:**  
  * *Wildland Resources:* Faculty like **Peter Adler** (Ecology Center Director, ecological modeling), **Karen Beard** (quantitative population/habitat analysis), **R. Douglas Ramsey** (RS/GIS Lab affiliation, geospatial research), **Kezia Manlove** (disease ecology modeling), **Jim Lutz** (forest ecology, potentially large dataset analysis/modeling), **Justin DeRose**, **Andrew Kulmatiski**, **David Stoner**, and **Larissa Yocom** work in areas inherently reliant on quantitative and often geospatial methods.9  
  * *Environment & Society:* The faculty teaching the **GeoAI certificate courses** (e.g., GEOG/NR 4805, 6855, 4825\) possess direct expertise in applying AI to geospatial problems.41 Student research supervised in this department, like **Logan Bolan's** work using AI and GIS for Arctic climate change impacts, exemplifies this integration.66  
  * *Watershed Sciences:* The **Watershed & Wildfires Research Collaborative (WWRC)** explicitly leverages data science, modeling, geospatial tools, and machine learning for hazard assessment.51 Faculty such as **Jeff Horsburgh** (ecohydrologic observatories, data management, sensor networks), **David Tarboton** (UWRL Director, hydrology, GIS), **Belize Lane**, **Colin Phillips**, and **Pin Shuai** work extensively with hydrological modeling and data analysis.67  
* **Collaborating Departments:**  
  * *Mathematics & Statistics:* **Brennan Bean's** research directly applies AI and advanced statistical methods to environmental problems, including spatial data, climate science, and natural resources, with recent projects modeling Bear Lake's future using AI.68 **John Stevens** works on bioinformatics and statistical methods for complex biological data, relevant to ecological genomics.69 Significantly, the department is actively recruiting tenure-track faculty in applied mathematics with a focus on computational math/data science and explicit interest in collaborating on biological, ecological, or environmental science problems, aiming to enhance the Mathematical Biology group and connect with the new DSAI Center.70 This recruitment signals a clear strategic direction to strengthen this interdisciplinary nexus.  
  * *Computer Science:* The department has broad expertise in AI, machine learning, data mining, and related fields.71 While specific natural resource collaborations aren't detailed in every snippet, the foundational expertise is present and potentially available for collaboration, facilitated by initiatives like the DSAI Center.  
  * *Geosciences:* Research involves Earth systems, human-environment interactions, and geospatial technology, often using laboratory and computational methods alongside fieldwork.72 Expertise in areas like geophysics, geochemistry, paleobiology, hydrology, and landscape evolution provides complementary skills for natural resource research.

This evidence points to a growing cohort of faculty at USU whose work lies at the intersection of natural resources and advanced computational methods. This expertise is distributed across QCNR and key partner departments like Math/Stat. The strategic hiring in Math/Stat specifically targeting this interdisciplinary space further underscores USU's commitment to building capacity.70

It is important to recognize that direct titles like "Professor of AI in Forestry" may be uncommon. Instead, the relevant expertise often resides within established fields like quantitative ecology, forest biometrics, geospatial science, disease modeling, hydrology, or statistics, where faculty apply computational tools to address domain-specific questions. For instance, a statistician like Brennan Bean applies AI to environmental modeling 68, and ecologists like Norah Saarman use AI for species identification.64 Successful interdisciplinary work often relies on collaboration between these domain experts and computational specialists, a process facilitated by centers like DSAI and initiatives like the WWRC. Students and researchers must actively seek out these cross-departmental connections.

Table 5 highlights illustrative examples of faculty research bridging these fields.

**Table 5: Illustrative Faculty Research at the Intersection of Natural Resources and Computational/Data Sciences**

## **Research Computing and Data Infrastructure**

Access to robust computational infrastructure is essential for research involving large datasets, complex models, and AI/ML techniques. USU provides resources through a combination of potential partnerships and internal initiatives.

### **A. Overview of Central Research Computing Resources (HPC)**

Historically, USU has utilized High-Performance Computing (HPC) resources, potentially including a system known as the "Aggie" cluster. However, a significant development occurred in Spring 2016 when what was described as the most heavily used cluster in USU HPC was relocated to the University of Utah's Center for High Performance Computing (CHPC).74 The hardware nodes purchased by USU faculty remained accessible to them through CHPC.74 This suggests that for some time, USU's primary general HPC capability may have been accessed via this arrangement with the University of Utah, rather than through a large, independent USU-managed HPC center. CHPC at the University of Utah offers substantial resources, including multiple HPC clusters (e.g., Notchpeak, Lonepeak, Kingspeak, Redwood, Granite) and dedicated machine learning/AI resources.75

More recently, USU has become involved in a statewide AI education initiative in collaboration with NVIDIA, launched around March 2025\.77 This public-private partnership aims to provide participating Utah universities, including USU, with resources specifically for developing skills in generative AI, including access to NVIDIA GPU-accelerated workstations in the cloud.77

This indicates an evolving strategy for research computing at USU. The reliance on CHPC may represent a model for general-purpose HPC, while the NVIDIA partnership signifies a targeted investment in newer, potentially more flexible cloud-based resources optimized for the demands of AI and machine learning. This multi-pronged approach allows USU to leverage existing partnerships while strategically investing in infrastructure tailored to emerging computational needs like GPU-intensive AI workloads.

### **B. GPU Availability**

Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are critical accelerators for deep learning and many machine learning tasks. Access to GPUs for USU researchers appears available through at least two avenues:

1. **CHPC (U of U):** CHPC maintains a GPU partition on its clusters. However, access to these resources is not automatic and requires users to submit a justification for their research needs.76  
2. **NVIDIA AI Education Initiative:** This new initiative explicitly includes providing participating institutions like USU with access to NVIDIA GPU-accelerated workstations, delivered via the cloud.77

The NVIDIA partnership represents a particularly significant development for AI/ML capabilities at USU, including for QCNR researchers. It promises dedicated access to GPU resources specifically geared towards AI education and research. This cloud-based model may offer greater flexibility and potentially a lower barrier to entry compared to navigating allocation processes for general-purpose HPC GPUs, especially for researchers who are not traditional HPC users but require GPU acceleration for specific AI applications in natural resources.

### **C. Supported AI/ML Software Stacks**

The usability of computational resources depends heavily on the availability of relevant software libraries and environments.

* **Foundational Languages (Python, R):** There is clear evidence of Python and R usage within QCNR. Courses like NR 6920 (Python Programming for GIS), GEOG 3700 (Python Programming for GIS), WILD 6580 (Data Management & Manipulation using R), and GEOG 5300 (Geospatial Analysis with R) are offered.43 Faculty in collaborating departments, like Brennan Bean in Math/Stat, also utilize these languages in their research and teaching.58 This widespread use ensures that students and researchers within the natural resource domain at USU develop familiarity with these essential data science languages.  
* **Advanced Frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.):** While specific libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch are not explicitly listed as supported software in the provided high-level documentation for CHPC or the older USU cluster 74, it is highly probable that environments supporting these standard deep learning frameworks are available. The CHPC "ML/AI Resources" 75 likely include them. Furthermore, the NVIDIA initiative, focused on AI education and leveraging GPU-accelerated cloud workstations 77, would almost certainly provide access to environments pre-configured with these industry-standard AI/ML libraries. The foundational skills in Python and R developed within QCNR programs prepare users to effectively utilize these more advanced libraries once access is provided.

### **D. Access Policies**

Policies governing access dictate how researchers and students can utilize these computational resources.

* **CHPC (U of U) Resources:** Access generally requires accounts and operates under an allocation system. Specific justification is needed to gain access to the GPU partition.76 The exact mechanism for USU researchers accessing these resources post-2016 relocation would depend on the specific USU-UofU agreement.  
* **NVIDIA AI Initiative Resources:** The initiative's focus on equipping universities, community colleges, and adult education programs for workforce training suggests an aim for relatively broad access, particularly for educational and skill-development purposes.77 This could be highly beneficial for QCNR students learning AI applications relevant to their field.  
* **General AI Tool Usage Policy:** Separate from compute resource access, USU provides guidance on the *use* of AI tools (like public large language models). This guidance stresses data security (no sensitive/restricted data in public tools), verification of AI-generated information, awareness of potential bias, and adherence to copyright and academic integrity standards.79

In summary, access policies likely differ based on the resource. The potentially more structured allocation and justification process for shared CHPC resources contrasts with the anticipated broader educational access model of the new NVIDIA initiative, offering different avenues for QCNR researchers and students depending on their needs.

## **Strategic Vision: AI, Data Science, and Computational Research in USU's Natural Resource Programs**

Utah State University demonstrates a growing strategic commitment to integrating AI, data science, and advanced computational methods across the institution, creating an environment that increasingly supports and influences natural resource programs.

### **A. Analysis of USU and QCNR Strategic Plans and Mission Statements**

At the university level, several key initiatives signal a strategic push towards AI and data science:

* **Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (DSAI) Center:** Launched in January 2024, the DSAI Center serves as a university-wide hub aiming to foster interdisciplinary faculty collaborations, connect industry partners with campus expertise, and establish USU as a data science and AI research resource for the state.53 While founded primarily by departments in Engineering, Business, and Science, its affiliate members include the College of Humanities and Social Sciences and the Center for Anticipatory Intelligence 66, indicating a broad reach. QCNR's engagement is evident through student research presented at the DSAI launch, such as projects applying GeoAI to Arctic climate change and AI to analyze qualitative sociological data from ranchers.66  
* **Statewide NVIDIA AI Education Initiative:** USU's participation in this major public-private partnership underscores a commitment to developing AI skills across its student body and faculty, aiming to prepare the workforce for AI's impact on all economic sectors, including those related to natural resources.77  
* **Research Development Focus:** The university's Research Development office actively promotes funding opportunities in "Mathematics, Computational & Data Sciences," "Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning," and related areas like "Climate and the Changing World," and has hosted summits on AI.80

In contrast, the available snippet of QCNR's mission statement focuses on understanding ecosystems, sustainable use, training leaders, and translating research into practice, without explicitly mentioning "AI" or "data science".1 However, the fundamental goals of QCNR—advancing scientific knowledge in complex natural systems, training effective managers, and applying research findings—are increasingly reliant on the capabilities offered by advanced computational tools. Modern natural resource science deals with vast and complex datasets (genomic, sensor, spatial, climate), and AI/data science provides powerful methods for extracting knowledge, making predictions, and informing management decisions. Therefore, the university-level strategic investments in AI/data science infrastructure and collaboration (DSAI Center, NVIDIA partnership) create crucial enabling conditions for QCNR to pursue its existing mission more effectively and innovatively. The organic emergence of AI applications within QCNR student research 66 suggests this integration is already underway.

### **B. Stated Priorities and Impact on Natural Resource Programs**

The strategic priorities associated with USU's AI initiatives point towards significant potential impacts on natural resource programs:

* **Fostering Collaboration:** A key priority of the DSAI Center is to "foster faculty collaborations across campus".53 This directly supports bridging expertise between computational methodologists (in CS, Stats, DAIS) and domain experts in QCNR.  
* **Targeted Hiring:** The explicit search by the Math & Stat department for faculty at the intersection of computational math/data science and ecological/environmental sciences, intended to collaborate with the DSAI Center and enhance the Mathematical Biology group 70, is a direct mechanism for infusing relevant computational expertise into areas supporting natural resource research.  
* **Workforce Development:** The NVIDIA initiative's goal of equipping educators and students with AI skills 77 will inevitably benefit QCNR students, preparing them for careers where data literacy and computational skills are increasingly valued in environmental and natural resource fields.  
* **Resource Hub:** The DSAI Center aims to be a campus resource 53, potentially offering consultation, workshops, or access to specialized software or platforms that QCNR researchers and students can leverage.

These priorities suggest a model where QCNR benefits from university-wide investments and expertise, rather than needing to develop all advanced computational capabilities internally. The focus on collaboration and targeted hiring aims to build the necessary bridges between disciplines.

### **C. Role of the Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (DSAI) Center**

The DSAI Center 53 is positioned as a central catalyst for AI and data science activities at USU. Its role extends beyond pure research to include fostering collaborations and connecting with industry. A particularly relevant component is the **Analytics Solutions Center (ASC)**.53 The ASC functions as a consulting entity, utilizing student teams under faculty mentorship to tackle real-world data challenges and develop AI/ML solutions for partners. This model presents a significant opportunity for QCNR. Research projects within the college facing complex data analysis or modeling tasks, or external partners working on natural resource issues, could potentially engage the ASC. Such collaborations would provide valuable practical experience for both data science students and potentially involved QCNR students, applying cutting-edge techniques to tangible environmental and resource management problems. This offers a pathway for QCNR to access specialized AI/ML expertise for specific projects and enhances experiential learning opportunities.

## **Hubs of Innovation: Research Centers, Institutes, and Collaborative Projects**

Beyond individual faculty and courses, specific centers, institutes, and large-scale projects serve as important hubs for integrating computational methods with natural resource research at USU.

## **Ethical Frameworks: AI Ethics and Responsible Conduct of Research**

As computational tools like AI become more integrated into research and decision-making, addressing the associated ethical considerations is crucial. USU has established policies and training related to both general research conduct and the specific challenges of AI.

### **A. USU's Policies on AI Ethics and Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR)**

USU provides institutional guidance on the responsible use of AI, emphasizing several key principles 79:

* **Data Privacy and Security:** Users are cautioned against entering sensitive or restricted data (e.g., PII, FERPA-protected data, proprietary research data) into public AI tools like ChatGPT, which lack inherent security compliance features.  
* **Mitigating Misinformation:** Recognizing that AI outputs can be unreliable or false, users must verify the accuracy of AI-generated content and properly cite the tools used.  
* **Confronting Bias:** AI models can reflect biases present in their training data. Users are expected to critically evaluate AI outputs for bias and correct them before use.  
* **Copyright and Academic Integrity:** Concerns about plagiarism and copyright infringement exist due to the opaque nature of AI training data. AI should not substitute for peer-reviewed research, and its use must comply with academic integrity policies.  
* **AI as a Tool:** AI is positioned as a tool to enhance learning and research, not replace critical thinking, instruction, or hands-on investigation.

Beyond this general AI guidance, the university mandates training in the Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR), defined as the practice of scientific investigation with integrity according to established professional norms and ethical principles.85 Furthermore, USU demonstrates a commitment to domain-specific ethics education through the inclusion of GEOG/NR 4825/6825 \- Geospatial Artificial Intelligence, Ethics, & Society within the GeoAI certificate program.41 This proactive approach, combining general AI awareness with specific ethics coursework in relevant programs, addresses the need for responsible innovation. Broader ethics courses like PHIL 1120 (Social Ethics) and PHIL/CAI 5400 (Ethics and Emerging Technology) are also available 41, alongside environmentally focused courses like ENVS 4020 (Foundations of Environmental Thought).36

### **B. Specific Training Programs and Requirements**

* **CITI RCR Training:** USU utilizes the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) platform for mandatory online RCR training.86 Researchers and students required to complete RCR training must pass the relevant CITI "Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) Curriculum" (choosing a focus like Physical Sciences or Social and Behavioral Research).86 This is tracked by the Division of Research Integrity and Compliance (DRIC).85  
* **Mandates:** This RCR training requirement applies broadly, driven significantly by federal funding agency mandates. As of August 2023, NSF requires RCR training for all faculty and senior personnel supported on their grants. DRIC tracks compliance for NSF, USDA-NIFA, and NIH grants.85 Given that QCNR researchers frequently seek funding from NSF and USDA-NIFA, this CITI RCR training requirement is directly applicable to many faculty, staff, and potentially graduate students within the college.

While the standard CITI RCR training provides essential grounding in general research ethics (e.g., data management, authorship, conflict of interest), it may not fully capture the specific ethical nuances introduced by AI/ML in the context of natural resource management. Issues such as algorithmic bias potentially leading to inequitable resource allocation, privacy concerns arising from widespread environmental sensor deployment, or the 'black box' nature of some AI models impacting transparency in conservation decisions, warrant deeper consideration. Therefore, specialized courses like "GeoAI Ethics and Society" 41 and broader discussions in courses like "Ethics and Emerging Technology" 41 serve as vital complements to the baseline CITI training, encouraging more profound ethical reflection tailored to the application domain for students and researchers working at this intersection.

## **Conclusion**

Utah State University possesses a strong foundation in traditional natural resource disciplines housed within the S.J. & Jessie E. Quinney College of Natural Resources (QCNR), complemented by growing capabilities and strategic investments in advanced computational methods, including GIS, remote sensing, data science, and artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML).

1. **Strong Natural Resource Programs with Foundational Quantitative Skills:** QCNR offers a comprehensive suite of accredited (where applicable, via SAF and SRM) undergraduate and graduate programs in forestry, rangeland ecology, wildlife ecology, watershed science, environmental science, and geography. Most undergraduate programs incorporate foundational training in statistics and introductory GIS, providing students with essential quantitative and spatial reasoning skills.  
2. **Emerging Integration of Advanced Computational Methods:** While foundational skills are widespread, the integration of advanced AI/ML, data science, and complex modeling into *required* QCNR undergraduate curricula appears less consistent. Deeper specialization typically occurs at the graduate level or through dedicated minors and certificates, notably the Applied GIS and the comprehensive Remote Sensing and Geospatial AI certificates offered via the Department of Environment and Society. These certificates, particularly the latter with its focus on advanced GeoAI and ethics, represent a significant strength.  
3. **Rich University-Wide Computational Ecosystem:** USU boasts considerable expertise and coursework in AI, ML, and data science within departments like Computer Science, Mathematics & Statistics, and Data Analytics & Information Systems. This creates significant opportunities for interdisciplinary learning for QCNR students, although accessing the most advanced courses may require proactive planning to fulfill mathematics and programming prerequisites beyond typical QCNR major requirements. Bridging courses appear to be emerging to facilitate this.  
4. **Growing Interdisciplinary Faculty Expertise:** There is clear evidence of faculty within QCNR and key collaborating departments (Math/Stat, Geosciences, CS) whose research actively bridges natural resource science with computational and data-intensive methodologies. Specific examples include AI applications in environmental modeling, geospatial AI for climate change assessment, machine learning for hazard prediction, and quantitative ecology. Strategic hiring initiatives, particularly in Mathematics & Statistics, explicitly aim to strengthen these interdisciplinary connections.  
5. **Evolving Research Computing Infrastructure:** USU's approach to HPC and AI compute resources appears multifaceted and evolving. While historically leveraging resources at the University of Utah's CHPC, the recent participation in the statewide NVIDIA AI Education Initiative signals a significant investment in providing accessible, cloud-based GPU resources specifically tailored for AI research and training. This complements existing infrastructure and lowers barriers for computationally intensive AI work in fields like natural resources. Foundational software like Python and R are well-integrated within QCNR, preparing users for advanced AI/ML libraries available through central resources.  
6. **Strategic University Commitment to AI/Data Science:** The establishment of the university-wide Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (DSAI) Center and the NVIDIA partnership demonstrate a clear institutional strategy to build capacity in these areas. While QCNR's mission statement may not explicitly mention AI, its goals inherently align with the capabilities these tools offer. The university's strategic initiatives provide the environment and resources for QCNR to increasingly leverage AI and data science to achieve its mission. Interdisciplinary collaboration, fostered by the DSAI Center, is a key intended mechanism for this integration.  
7. **Key Hubs for Innovation:** Research centers like the Ecology Center and the Utah Water Research Laboratory (with its AggieAir and UCHIC components) serve as critical hubs where advanced data generation (remote sensing, sensors) and computational analysis (modeling, hydroinformatics, AI applications) converge with natural resource science. Collaborative projects like the WWRC further demonstrate USU's capacity for sophisticated, computationally intensive environmental research.  
8. **Proactive Approach to Ethics:** USU provides general guidance on responsible AI use and mandates standard RCR training (via CITI) applicable to QCNR researchers. Importantly, the university also incorporates domain-specific ethics education, notably through the dedicated "GeoAI Ethics and Society" course within the GeoAI certificate, acknowledging the unique ethical considerations of applying these technologies in sensitive areas like natural resource management.

In conclusion, Utah State University presents a robust environment for students and researchers interested in the intersection of natural resources and advanced computational sciences. While the deepest integration of AI/ML is currently more prominent at the graduate level and in specialized programs, the university's strategic investments in the DSAI Center, the NVIDIA partnership, targeted faculty hiring, and dedicated research infrastructure create strong pathways for continued growth and innovation in applying these powerful tools to address complex environmental and resource management challenges. Facilitating cross-disciplinary interaction and ensuring QCNR students can navigate prerequisite pathways to access advanced computational coursework will be key to fully realizing this potential.
