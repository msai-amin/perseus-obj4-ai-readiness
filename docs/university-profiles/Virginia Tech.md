The College of Natural Resources and Environment (CNRE) serves as the primary hub, offering well-established, professionally aligned programs in Forestry, Fish and Wildlife Conservation, and Sustainable Biomaterials, alongside newer majors like Environmental Data Science designed to explicitly bridge environmental science with computational expertise. Curricular analysis reveals foundational training in Geographic Information Systems (GIS), remote sensing, statistics, and modeling within CNRE, complemented by a growing suite of data analytics and ML courses accessible through cross-departmental collaborations, particularly with Computer Science (CS), Statistics (STAT), and Computational Modeling and Data Analytics (CMDA). Faculty expertise spans applied geospatial and quantitative ecological methods within CNRE, bolstered by key researchers in CS, STAT, and Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) focusing on foundational AI/ML and their application to environmental challenges. This expertise is supported by robust, centrally managed research infrastructure via Advanced Research Computing (ARC), which provides state-of-the-art High-Performance Computing (HPC) clusters, extensive Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) resources, standard AI/ML software stacks (Python, R, TensorFlow, PyTorch), and accessible usage policies for researchers. Strategically, the university's strong push towards AI and data science aligns well with CNRE's mission to address complex, data-intensive environmental problems. A network of interdisciplinary centers (e.g., CEARS, CMI, GCC) and successful external grant capture further enables collaborative, computationally intensive research. While a university-wide AI ethics policy is currently under development, established Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) training protocols provide a foundational ethical framework. Key strengths lie in the existing disciplinary expertise, advanced infrastructure, and strategic alignment. Potential challenges include ensuring accessible pathways for CNRE students into advanced computational coursework and fostering broader computational literacy across the college. Overall, Virginia Tech is well-positioned to be a leader at the intersection of AI, computation, and natural resources, leveraging its considerable assets to tackle critical environmental issues.

This includes detailed examination of college and departmental web pages, undergraduate and graduate program catalogs, course descriptions, faculty profiles and research summaries, documentation pertaining to research computing infrastructure (ARC), university and college strategic plans, descriptions of research centers and institutes, grant award announcements, and policy documents related to research ethics and conduct. The analysis synthesizes this information to provide an objective assessment of Virginia Tech's activities and resources at the intersection of AI/computation and natural resources.

## **Overview of Natural Resource Programs at Virginia Tech**

**College of Natural Resources and Environment (CNRE):** The College of Natural Resources and Environment (CNRE) stands as the principal academic unit at Virginia Tech dedicated to natural resource education and research.4 Established officially in 1992, its programmatic roots extend back to the hiring of the first forestry professor in 1925\.4 CNRE provides an integrated education focused on renewable natural resource management, conservation, utilization, and sustainability.5 The college comprises four core departments: Fish and Wildlife Conservation (FWC), Forest Resources and Environmental Conservation (FREC), Geography, and Sustainable Biomaterials (SBIO).4 It serves a substantial student body, with enrollment figures around 1,000 students noted in past years.4 The college's mission emphasizes preparing future leaders to address complex natural resource issues through world-class research and education.1

**Program Offerings:** CNRE offers a diverse portfolio of undergraduate and graduate degrees. Key undergraduate majors include Forestry (with tracks like Forest Resource Management, Forest Operations and Business, Urban Forestry), Wildlife Conservation, Fish Conservation (with options like Freshwater, Marine, Human Dimensions), Geography, Meteorology, Sustainable Biomaterials, Packaging Systems and Design, Water: Resources, Policy, and Management, Environmental Conservation and Society, Environmental Resources Management, and the computationally focused Environmental Data Science major.4 At the graduate level, the college offers Master of Science (M.S.), Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.), Master of Forestry (M.F.), and Master of Natural Resources (M.N.R. \- including online and executive hybrid options) degrees across its departments, supporting advanced research and specialization.4

**Accreditation and Professional Alignment:** CNRE maintains strong connections to professional standards through accreditation and curriculum alignment for many of its programs.

* **Forestry:** The undergraduate programs in Forestry, encompassing tracks such as Forest Resource Management, Forest Operations and Business, and Urban Forestry, are accredited by the Society of American Foresters (SAF), the recognized national body for the forestry profession.5 This accreditation ensures graduates qualify as professional foresters and meet established educational standards.15  
* **Fish and Wildlife Conservation:** While professional societies like The Wildlife Society (TWS) and the American Fisheries Society (AFS) primarily offer *individual* certifications rather than programmatic accreditation 16, the curricula for Virginia Tech's Fish and Wildlife Conservation majors are designed to meet the educational requirements for these certifications.5 This alignment facilitates graduates' paths toward professional recognition as Certified Wildlife Biologists® or Associate Wildlife Biologists® (TWS) or equivalent AFS credentials.  
* **Sustainable Biomaterials:** The Sustainable Biomaterials major holds accreditation from the Society of Wood Science and Technology (SWST), the relevant professional accrediting body for this field.5  
* **Meteorology:** The B.S. in Meteorology, offered through the Department of Geography, was developed following guidelines from the American Meteorological Society (AMS) and the National Weather Service, ensuring it meets federal civil service requirements (GS-1340) for meteorologists.5  
* **Environmental Science/Resources Management:** Notably, specific program-level accreditation from bodies like the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) or the Society for Range Management (SRM) is not indicated for the broader environmental science-oriented majors within CNRE (e.g., Environmental Conservation and Society, Environmental Resources Management, Environmental Data Science).5 This contrasts with the B.S. in Civil Engineering (with its environmental focus) offered by the College of Engineering, which is ABET-accredited.18 Similarly, no SRM accreditation for a dedicated Range Management program at Virginia Tech was identified.20 These CNRE programs rely on the university's overall accreditation by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC).19

The pattern of accreditation within CNRE suggests that the more traditionally defined, vocational programs (Forestry, FWC, SBIO) adhere closely to established external professional standards. The absence of similar specific accreditation for the broader environmental science and management majors may reflect a strategic choice towards greater curricular flexibility. This flexibility could be particularly advantageous for integrating rapidly evolving interdisciplinary fields like data science and computational modeling, as clearly demonstrated by the establishment and curriculum of the Environmental Data Science major. This approach allows these programs to adapt more readily to emerging scientific frontiers and workforce demands compared to programs governed by more rigid external accreditation criteria.

**Table 1: CNRE Program Accreditations and Professional Alignments**

Undergraduate requirements often include introductory statistics courses like STAT 2004 or STAT 3005, or specialized versions like STAT 3615/3616 (Biological Statistics).27 More advanced quantitative methods courses are embedded within specific majors, such as FIW 4404/4414 (Quantitative Methods in Fisheries/Wildlife Science) and their graduate counterparts (FIW 5404/5414).26 Forestry includes courses like FOR 5224 (Forest Biometry), and graduate programs often require research methods courses like FOR 5494\.24  
* **Modeling:** Computational modeling is introduced through courses like GEOG 4084 (Modeling with GIS), GEOG 4334 (Land Change Modeling), and FIW 5514 (Fish Population Dynamics and Modeling).21  
* **Environmental Data Science Major:** This B.S. program, housed in FREC, represents a dedicated effort to formally integrate environmental science with data science and computational skills.5 Its curriculum explicitly requires courses beyond traditional natural resource offerings, including FREC 1044/3044 (Introduction to/Environmental Data Science), FREC 4114 (Information Technologies for Natural Resource Management), FREC 4214 (Forest Photogrammetry), statistics (STAT 3615), calculus (MATH 1025/1026 or 1225/1226), computer programming (CS 1064 Python or equivalent), and courses from Business Information Technology (BIT 3424 Business Analytics Modeling, BIT 3514 Systems Analysis, BIT 3524 Database Management).27 A capstone project (FREC 4044\) ensures application of these integrated skills.27

**Minors and Certificates:** Students can further enhance their computational skills through specialized minors and certificates.

* **Geographic Information Science Minor:** This popular minor requires foundational GIS (GEOG 2084), modeling (GEOG 4084), remote sensing (GEOG 4354/FREC 4214), and programming (CS 1064 Python), plus electives in areas like R programming for geospatial applications (GEOG 4254), spatial analysis (GEOG 4314), web mapping (GEOG 4394), and geovisualization (GEOG 4404).5  
* **Geospatial Information Technology (GIT) Graduate Certificate:** Offered through the Department of Geography, this certificate requires completion of four graduate-level courses in GIS and related technologies.6 While specific courses are not detailed in the snippets, they likely draw from advanced offerings in GIS, remote sensing, spatial analysis, and programming (e.g., GEOG 5084, 5314, 5354, 5384, FOR 5254, 6214).23 This certificate is highly relevant for natural resource professionals seeking advanced geospatial skills.  
* **GEOINT Certificate:** An undergraduate certificate focusing on Geospatial Intelligence, requiring core GIS and remote sensing courses plus electives and a capstone experience.36  
* **Other Options:** CNRE also offers Pathways minors related to data-intensive topics like Climate and Society.5 University-wide minors, such as Data and Decisions (supported by the Academy of Data Science 37), could also complement CNRE studies.

**Advanced AI/ML/HPC/Data Science Courses (Cross-Departmental):** Access to cutting-edge AI, ML, HPC, and data science expertise primarily resides in departments outside CNRE. Key advanced undergraduate (4000-level) and graduate (5000-level+) courses include:

* **Computer Science (CS):** Offers foundational AI (CS 4804), Machine Learning (CS 4824/ECE 4424), Data Analytics (CS/STAT/CMDA 3654, 4654), Parallel Computation (CS 4234), and numerous graduate courses in specialized AI/ML topics (e.g., CS 5644 ML w/ Big Data, CS 6804 Adv Topics Intelligent Systems including ML for Epidemiology, Data-Centric AI, ML on Graphs, AI-powered Molecular Modeling).28 Prerequisites typically involve CS 2114 (Software Design & Data Structures) and CS 3114 (Data Structures & Algorithms), along with relevant math and statistics.40  
* **Statistics (STAT):** Provides courses in Data Analytics (STAT/CS/CMDA 3654, 4654), Statistical Computing (STAT 4004, STAT 5154), Deep Learning (STAT 4744), and various applied statistics courses relevant to data science (e.g., STAT 4504 Multivariate Analysis, STAT 4534 Time Series).28 Graduate courses cover Probability and Inference Theory (STAT 5104, 5114\) and Linear Models (STAT 5124).48 Prerequisites often include calculus (MATH 1225/1226), linear algebra (MATH 2114), multivariable calculus (MATH 2204), programming (CS 1064 or similar), and foundational statistics (STAT 3xxx).28  
* **Electrical & Computer Engineering (ECE):** Offers Machine Learning (ECE 4424/CS 4824), AI & Engineering Applications (ECE 4524), Computer Vision (ECE 4554/5554), and graduate courses in Advanced ML (ECE 5424), Deep Learning (ECE 6524), Multiprocessor Programming (ECE 5510), and potentially others relevant to high-performance or embedded computing for sensing.39 ECE prerequisites are often demanding, requiring completion of specific ECE course sequences, advanced math (differential equations), and probability/statistics tailored for engineers.39  
* **Computational Modeling & Data Analytics (CMDA):** This interdisciplinary program offers core courses in Mathematical Modeling (CMDA 3605/3606), Data Analytics and Visualization (CMDA/CS/STAT 3654), Intermediate Data Analytics and ML (CMDA/CS/STAT 4654), and a Capstone Project (CMDA 4864).42 Prerequisites are rooted in their integrated quantitative science sequence (CMDA 2005/2006), calculus, linear algebra, and Python programming (CS 1064/2064/2114).42

**Accessibility Analysis:** The pathway for CNRE students to engage with AI and advanced computation appears tiered. Foundational geospatial and quantitative skills are well-integrated within the college. The Environmental Data Science major provides a structured pathway to intermediate data analytics and machine learning, fulfilling many prerequisites for courses like CMDA/CS/STAT 4654\.27 However, accessing the most advanced, specialized courses in AI, ML theory, HPC, or deep learning offered by CS, STAT, or ECE generally requires a more substantial background in computer science theory (data structures, algorithms), advanced mathematics (multivariable calculus, differential equations, proofs), and upper-level statistics than is typically required for traditional CNRE majors like Forestry or Wildlife Conservation.28 Consequently, CNRE students aiming for deep expertise in these advanced computational areas likely need to pursue minors (e.g., CS, STAT, Math) or carefully select free electives to build the necessary prerequisite foundation, requiring proactive advising and planning. This structure effectively encourages specialization, either through the dedicated Environmental Data Science major or through complementary minors, for those seeking to operate at the cutting edge of AI/ML application in natural resources.

* **Fish and Wildlife Conservation (FWC):** Expertise includes quantitative ecology and population dynamics (Catlin 58), spatial epidemiology and ecological niche modeling using biogeographic approaches (Escobar 58), fisheries population dynamics and modeling (Jiao 60, Frimpong 10), and habitat modeling.60 Marcella Kelly, as Associate Department Head for Graduate Affairs, likely oversees programs incorporating quantitative training.7  
* **Forest Resources and Environmental Conservation (FREC):** This department hosts significant expertise in geospatial analysis, remote sensing, and modeling. Valerie Thomas and Randolph Wynne co-direct CEARS and research remote sensing, ecosystem dynamics, big data, and environmental analytics.25 Quinn Thomas focuses on ecosystem modeling, ecological forecasting, and environmental data science.25 Corey Green works on forest biometrics, inventory, and remote sensing.61 Phillip Radtke specializes in digital forest modeling, terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), and forest inventory/analytics.25 Others apply modeling in specific domains: Kelly Cobourn (bioeconomic modeling, water policy 61), Ashleigh Kirker (hydrologic modeling 61), Daniel McLaughlin (ecohydrology, watershed modeling 61). Faculty like Jason Holliday and Carrie Fearer utilize bioinformatics and genomics.61 John McGee focuses on geospatial extension.61 Quantitative economics and policy modeling are strengths of Gregory Amacher, Jay Sullivan, and Stella Schons DoValle.61 The department explicitly lists Geospatial Analysis and Biometrics as a research focus area, applying remote sensing, GIS, statistics, informatics, and modeling.62  
* **Geography:** The department has strong capabilities in GIScience, remote sensing, and computational geography. Yang Shao co-directs CEARS and researches remote sensing, GIS, and land change modeling.25 Fangzheng Lyu's expertise explicitly includes Geospatial Data Science, Computational Science, CyberGIS, and Geospatial AI, applying machine learning to urban dynamics.36 Andrew Ellis applies modeling to meteorology and hydroclimatology.36 Junghwan Kim uses geospatial data science for human mobility and environmental health studies.36 Craig Ramseyer utilizes climate modeling and artificial neural networks.36 Thomas Pingel and Santosh Rijal contribute expertise in GIS, remote sensing, and spatial analysis.25  
* **Sustainable Biomaterials (SBIO):** While the primary focus is materials science, chemistry, and engineering 65, quantitative and modeling approaches are employed. Laszlo Horvath uses computer modeling for packaging and pallet performance.66 Jennifer Russell and Kiara Winans apply systems thinking and life-cycle assessment, involving quantitative modeling.66 However, explicit research in AI or advanced data science within SBIO was not prominent in the reviewed materials.26

**Collaborating Department Faculty:** Crucial foundational and advanced expertise in AI, ML, statistics, and HPC resides in collaborating departments, with several faculty demonstrating specific interests relevant to natural resources.

* **Computer Science (CS):** Anuj Karpatne is a key figure, focusing on knowledge-guided machine learning and theory-guided data science with direct applications in climate science, hydrology, and ecology.69 Chang-Tien Lu works on spatial databases and data mining.71 Naren Ramakrishnan applies data mining to computational epidemiology and biology.71 Debswapna Bhattacharya develops AI for molecular modeling.38 T. M. Murali focuses on computational systems biology and bioinformatics.71 Layne Watson, affiliated with CEARS, works in numerical analysis and optimization.25  
* **Statistics (STAT):** Leah Johnson works directly at the intersection of statistics, mathematics, and ecology, developing Bayesian inference methods for mechanistic models of infectious disease dynamics, population ecology, and climate change impacts.73 Several faculty specialize in spatial statistics and environmental statistics, including Marco Ferreira, David Higdon (also computer model emulation), Eric Smith (department head, ecological statistics), and Hongxiao Zhu.73 Robert Gramacy works on Bayesian modeling, ML, and statistical computing, while Scotland Leman focuses on Bayesian inference, data mining, and signal processing.73

**Interdisciplinary Collaboration:** The structure at Virginia Tech encourages and relies on interdisciplinary collaboration. Centers like CEARS (linking FREC, Geography, CS, AAE) 25, CMI (integrating field ecology and geospatial tech for resource management agencies) 82, and the Global Change Center (spanning numerous departments to address climate change, biodiversity, etc.) 83 serve as vital conduits for connecting domain experts in natural resources with computational methodologists. Faculty like Karpatne (CS) and Johnson (STAT) exemplify bridging roles.70 The new inter-college M.S. in Data Science further institutionalizes this collaborative approach.37

The overall faculty landscape reveals substantial capacity within CNRE for applying established geospatial, modeling, and quantitative ecological methods. Cutting-edge, foundational research in AI, ML, and computational statistics resides primarily in CS, STAT, and ECE. The presence of key faculty in these computational departments with explicit interests in environmental, ecological, or biological applications creates fertile ground for synergistic collaborations, actively facilitated by the university's network of interdisciplinary research centers.
