# **Washington State University**

### **Introduction**

This report details the integration and application of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Data Science, and associated advanced computational methodologies within the natural resource science programs and research landscape at Washington State University (WSU). The escalating complexity of environmental and natural resource challenges—ranging from understanding climate change impacts and conserving biodiversity to ensuring sustainable agriculture and managing vital resources—increasingly necessitates sophisticated computational approaches for analysis, modeling, and decision support.1

Washington State University is uniquely positioned to address these interdisciplinary demands, possessing established strengths in both natural resource sciences and computational fields. Natural resource programs are primarily anchored within the School of the Environment (SoE), an academic unit with connections to both the College of Arts and Sciences (CAS) and the College of Agricultural, Human, and Natural Resource Sciences (CAHNRS).1 This structure fosters collaboration and access to diverse expertise. Concurrently, WSU maintains robust programs in computational disciplines through the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) in the Voiland College of Engineering and Architecture (VCEA), the university-wide Program in Data Analytics, and the Department of Mathematics and Statistics within CAS.14

The focus on computationally driven natural resource science aligns directly with WSU's institutional strategic priorities, which emphasize research innovation, interdisciplinary scholarship, and tackling grand societal challenges.20 The strategic plans of CAHNRS, CAS, and VCEA similarly underscore the importance of advancing research excellence, fostering collaboration, and ensuring the real-world impact of academic endeavors.12

This report will explore the educational foundations preparing students for this interdisciplinary field, delve into the specific AI, ML, and data science capabilities available at WSU, profile key faculty and research initiatives working at this intersection, detail the supporting computational infrastructure, discuss the ethical frameworks guiding this work, and conclude with an assessment of WSU's strengths and future directions in applying AI to natural resource challenges.

### **Computational Foundations in WSU Natural Resource Programs**

WSU offers several core degree programs focused on natural resources, primarily administered through the School of the Environment (SoE). The SoE's unique position, drawing resources and faculty from both CAHNRS and CAS, provides a structurally conducive environment for interdisciplinary study.13 Key undergraduate and graduate programs include:

* **B.S. Forest Ecology and Management:** This program trains students to create, manage, conserve, and restore forest ecosystems.9 Accredited by the Society of American Foresters 9 (provisionally noted in 27), the curriculum provides a strong background in plant sciences, forest measurements, and stand management.9 Crucially, it emphasizes spatial analysis, including landscape ecology and Geographic Information Systems (GIS).9 Graduates are prepared for careers in forestry, resource management, environmental policy, geospatial analysis, remote sensing, and wildland fire management.9  
* **B.S. Wildlife Ecology and Conservation Sciences:** Focusing on the ecology, habitat, conservation, and management of wild animals, this major integrates fieldwork with advanced analytical techniques.10 Students gain hands-on experience through WSU's unique captive wildlife facilities (including grizzly bears and endangered species) and field projects.28 The curriculum covers core wildlife biology, ecology, habitat management, conservation genetics, population modeling, and geospatial analysis.28 The program prepares graduates for careers as wildlife or fishery biologists, managers, researchers, conservation specialists, and meets the U.S. Office of Personnel Management requirements for these roles.28 An optional pre-veterinary track is also available.28  
* **B.S. Environmental and Ecosystem Sciences (EES):** This interdisciplinary major provides a broad science and social science foundation with flexibility for specialization.1 Students can focus on areas such as aquatic ecology, climate change biology, landscape and restoration ecology, and notably, spatial analysis and remote sensing.1 The curriculum includes hands-on research and management experience, preparing students for diverse environmental careers or graduate studies.1  
* **Ph.D. in Environmental & Natural Resource Sciences:** This research-intensive program integrates biological, physical, and social sciences to address the complex issues surrounding the use, management, and protection of the environment and natural resources.3 Specializations are offered in areas like environmental policy, aquatic ecology, forest ecology, wildlife ecology, conservation, biodiversity, and spatial aspects of natural resources.3 The curriculum aims to produce scientists capable of leadership roles in research and management, requiring advanced knowledge of ecosystems, research methods (including statistics and modeling), and environmental issues and ethics.3

### **Integration of Quantitative Skills**

A critical component of preparing students for modern natural resource science is the integration of quantitative and computational skills within these curricula:

* **GIS and Remote Sensing:** Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and remote sensing are foundational tools. An introductory GIS course (SOILS 368\) is a common requirement across the EES, Forest Ecology, and Wildlife Ecology majors, ensuring baseline spatial analysis competency.1 The Forest Ecology program further requires SOIL SCI 374 (Remote Sensing & Airphoto Interpretation) and SOIL SCI 468 (ArcGIS & Spatial Analysis), and offers SOE 486 (Applied Remote Sensing: From Drones to Satellites) as an elective.27 The EES major offers a specialization track in Spatial Analysis and Remote Sensing.1 Additionally, a Minor in Geospatial Analysis is integrated into the Forest Ecology and Management curriculum, signifying the importance of these skills for the discipline.11 Geospatial analysis and remote sensing are also explicitly listed as career paths for graduates.9  
* **Statistics and Quantitative Methods:** All core natural resource programs mandate foundational courses in mathematics and statistics.1 Specific requirements often include introductory statistics (e.g., STAT 212\) 31 and may involve more advanced courses like STAT 360/370 (Probability and Statistics) 1 or STAT 412 (Statistical Methods in Research I) depending on the major or electives chosen.1 Discipline-specific courses further reinforce quantitative skills, such as SOE 204 (Natural Resource Measurements) 27, SOE 310 (Methods in Wildlife Ecology) 28, and SOE 404 (Sampling Terrestrial Ecosystems).27  
* **Modeling:** The concept of modeling is explicitly addressed in courses like SOE 441 (Population Ecology), which examines the dynamics of animal populations, a topic inherently reliant on mathematical and statistical models.28 The Ph.D. program in Environmental & Natural Resource Sciences also requires demonstrated competency in modeling as part of its research methods training.3 Faculty research, such as that by Dr. Erin Clancey in Vet Med, directly involves mathematical and statistical modeling of biological processes like disease transmission.46

An examination of these curricula reveals that while foundational quantitative skills like GIS and statistics are integrated components, advanced computational topics such as AI and machine learning are not typically standard requirements within the core natural resource degree paths.1 This structure necessitates that students aiming for deep expertise in these advanced areas actively pursue them through electives, minors, or potentially dual majors, requiring careful academic planning. However, the positioning of the School of the Environment across both CAHNRS and CAS 13 inherently facilitates student access to a wider spectrum of courses and faculty expertise, including those in computationally intensive fields housed in departments like Mathematics & Statistics (CAS) or Computer Science (VCEA), compared to programs confined within a single college.

Relevant options include minors in Geospatial Analysis, Forestry, Wildlife Ecology, Environmental Science, and Natural Resources.11 While specific catalog links for Pullman-based minors in Computer Science, Statistics, or Data Analytics were inaccessible in the source material 80, degree programs often encourage minors and list relevant course options.57 WSU offers several undergraduate certificates relevant to computational and data-intensive work, including Foundations of Data Analytics, Intermediate Data Analytics, Advanced Data Science, Game Studies and Design, Graphic Design, Social Media, Professional Writing, and Sustainable Organizational Leadership.61 A specific GIS certificate was not identified in the available documentation.85

The establishment of a dedicated Data Analytics program, multiple certificate options, and strong offerings within EECS and Statistics signals a growing ecosystem for data science and AI education at WSU.16 This provides diverse pathways for students, including those in natural resource fields, to acquire these increasingly critical skills. However, accessing advanced AI/ML courses like CPT S 437, 440, and 434 presents a potential hurdle for students outside of computer science. These courses typically require prerequisites such as CPT S 215 (Programming Tools), CPT S 223 (Advanced Data Structures), or CPT S 233 (Programming II \- Java).51 These foundational CS courses are generally not part of the standard curriculum for majors like Forest Ecology or Wildlife Ecology.31 Therefore, natural resource students interested in deep computational expertise must plan carefully, potentially incorporating these prerequisites as electives or pursuing a minor or dual major in a computational field.

### **Research Infrastructure and Resources**

Effective research at the intersection of AI and natural resource science demands significant computational power and supporting infrastructure. WSU provides these capabilities primarily through its central research computing unit and specialized research centers and field stations.

* **Center for Institutional Research Computing (CIRC):** CIRC serves as the university's core facility for high-performance computing (HPC), providing hardware resources, technical support, user guidance, and training to the entire WSU research community across all campuses.111 Their goal is to advance computational and data-intensive research by offering state-of-the-art infrastructure and fostering computational literacy.111 CIRC offers help desk support via scheduled Zoom appointments.113  
* **Kamiak HPC Cluster:** WSU's primary HPC resource is the Kamiak cluster.111  
  * **Operational Model:** Kamiak operates on a condominium model. Faculty investors and colleges purchase compute nodes, gaining prioritized access. However, idle cycles on all nodes are made available to the broader WSU research community via a shared backfill partition named "kamiak".114 A fairshare scheduling system ensures equitable access over time, though backfill jobs can be preempted by node owners.114  
  * **Access:** The cluster is available at no direct cost for research use by all WSU faculty, students, and staff. User accounts must be sponsored by a faculty member.114 Access is via Secure Shell (ssh) using standard WSU network IDs and passwords.115  
  * **Hardware Specifications:** As documented, Kamiak comprises 168 compute nodes with varying specifications, including Intel Xeon processors ranging from Ivy Bridge to Sapphire Rapids generations, core counts from 20 to 80 per node, and RAM from 128GB up to 2TB.114 The cluster features a high-speed HDR100 InfiniBand interconnect and 1 Petabyte of all-flash NVMe shared storage managed by a WekaIO parallel file system.114 Notably, Kamiak includes dedicated GPU resources crucial for AI/ML workloads. There is an NSF-funded "camas" GPU partition open to all researchers, providing priority access for GPU jobs.114 Additionally, the main Kamiak partition includes nodes equipped with powerful NVIDIA H100 and A100 GPUs.114 Investors can also purchase dedicated specialty nodes, including configurations with multiple H100 GPUs.117  
  * **Storage:** Users receive a home directory (/home) with a default quota (100GB) that is backed up.115 Principal Investigators (PIs) receive lab storage (/data/lab) with a default quota (500GB), protected by snapshots but not fully backed up; additional lab storage can be rented.115 Temporary scratch storage (/scratch) is available (10TB limit per user) but has a 2-week data lifetime and is not backed up.115  
  * **Job Management:** The Slurm workload manager is used for resource allocation and job submission (via sbatch), monitoring (squeue), and cancellation (scancel).115  
* **Software Environment:**  
  * **Modules:** Software availability is managed using environment modules (module avail, module load).115  
  * **Python:** Multiple versions of Python 3 are available. CIRC strongly recommends using Anaconda3 or Miniconda3 distributions, loaded via modules (module load anaconda3), for managing Python environments and packages.119 Users can create custom conda environments (conda create \-n myenv), activate them (source activate myenv), and install necessary packages using conda install or pip install.119 Users are advised against using conda init.119  
  * **R:** The R statistical language is widely used in statistical modeling courses (e.g., DATA 435 70, STAT 436 62) and is mentioned in introductory data analytics syllabi 64, indicating its availability on campus systems, likely via an environment module on Kamiak.  
  * **AI/ML Libraries:** Standard AI/ML libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, and Scikit-learn, which are predominantly Python-based, can be readily installed by users into their personal conda environments on Kamiak.119 The availability of high-end NVIDIA GPUs (H100s, A100s) makes Kamiak suitable for accelerating computations with frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch that are optimized for GPU usage.114  
* **Supporting Research Centers & Field Stations:**  
  * **Research Centers:** WSU hosts several centers relevant to data-intensive natural resource and agricultural research. These include the AgAID Institute (AI for agriculture) 94, the Center for Precision & Automated Agricultural Systems (CPAAS) 7, the Center for Sustaining Agriculture & Natural Resources (CSANR) 7, AgWeather Net 123, and the Center for Social and Environmental Justice.7 These centers often serve as hubs for interdisciplinary projects and data generation.  
  * **Field Stations:** WSU operates numerous agricultural and environmental field stations, such as the Cook Agronomy Farm, Lind Dryland Research Station, Palouse Conservation Field Station, and the Meyer's Point Environmental Field Station in Puget Sound.124 These facilities provide essential sites for data collection, experimentation, and validation of models developed using AI and computational approaches in real-world environmental settings.

The provision of the centrally managed Kamiak HPC cluster, equipped with modern CPUs, substantial memory, fast networking, and cutting-edge GPUs (including H100s and A100s), represents a robust and accessible infrastructure foundation for computationally demanding research.111 The condominium model balances investor needs with broad community access, lowering the barrier for researchers across disciplines, including natural resources, to utilize HPC.114 Furthermore, the software environment, particularly the support for user-managed Anaconda/Miniconda environments, offers researchers the necessary flexibility to install and utilize the specific versions of Python, R, and specialized AI/ML libraries (like TensorFlow and PyTorch) required for their work.115 This adaptability is crucial in rapidly evolving fields like AI. However, a potential operational consideration arises from the storage policies. The lack of comprehensive backup for lab and scratch storage, coupled with the ephemeral nature of scratch space, necessitates diligent data management and backup strategies by individual research groups, particularly for projects generating or analyzing large environmental datasets.115

### **Ethical Considerations and Training**

The increasing use of AI and complex computational methods in research necessitates careful attention to ethical considerations and robust training in responsible conduct. WSU addresses this through university-wide guidelines and training requirements.

* **WSU Guidelines on Generative AI (GAI):** WSU has established specific guidelines addressing the use of GAI tools, particularly those generating content like text and images.126 Key principles include:  
  * **Human Oversight:** AI can augment but not replace human knowledge, judgment, and accountability. All AI-generated content requires thorough human review and verification.126  
  * **Accuracy and Accountability:** Users are responsible for the accuracy of AI-generated content and must be vigilant against "hallucinations" (plausible but false information) and inadvertent meaning changes.126  
  * **Bias Awareness:** GAI models can perpetuate or amplify biases present in their training data; users must critically evaluate outputs for fairness.126  
  * **Copyright and Plagiarism:** Care must be taken to avoid plagiarism, as models may be trained on copyrighted material. Modification of output may be necessary.126  
  * **Imagery:** AI-generated images should be credited and must not depict WSU individuals or create false representations of campus events. AI manipulation of existing images should not misleadingly alter significant elements.126  
  * **Data Security:** Critically, sensitive or confidential data should generally *not* be input into external GAI tools, as they are unlikely to meet WSU data security policies.127 This includes caution with AI meeting tools discussing sensitive topics.127  
  * **Research Integrity:** Researchers must ensure the integrity, accuracy, and originality of proposals and publications, attributing GAI use appropriately and avoiding misconduct like plagiarism or data fabrication potentially facilitated by AI tools.127  
* **Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) Training:** WSU mandates RCR training for researchers, particularly those involved in funded projects, often utilizing the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) platform.128  
  * **General Requirements:** Training typically covers core areas such as data acquisition and management, authorship, peer review, conflicts of interest, research misconduct, and the societal impacts of research.128 Federal agencies like NIH and NSF have specific RCR training mandates for funded personnel.131 CITI Basic Course completion often requires renewal (e.g., every three years).129  
  * **Implementation:** The specific format and requirements can vary. The Elson S. Floyd College of Medicine, for example, utilizes a 9-hour series involving discussion and case studies.128 CAHNRS and VCEA emphasize safety training relevant to labs and agricultural settings, integrating required WSU online safety modules, but their specific RCR program details beyond general safety are less explicit in the provided documents.132 Graduate programs within the School of the Environment list required coursework, including ethics (SOE 594 for PhD), but don't detail the specific RCR training mechanism (e.g., CITI, embedded modules) in the available snippets.33

The development of explicit guidelines for GAI use 126 demonstrates a proactive institutional approach to addressing the novel ethical challenges presented by these technologies, particularly concerning data security, accuracy, bias, and academic integrity. This foresight is crucial as AI becomes more integrated into research workflows. While RCR training is a university-wide requirement, often driven by federal mandates 131, the specific implementation appears somewhat decentralized across colleges.128 This variation suggests that researchers, especially graduate students and postdoctoral scholars, must actively confirm and fulfill the specific RCR training requirements mandated by their respective colleges, departments, and funding sources to ensure compliance.

**7\. Conclusion and Future Directions**

Washington State University demonstrates substantial and growing capabilities at the confluence of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Science, and Natural Resource Sciences. The university leverages a strong foundation in core natural resource programs within the School of the Environment, complemented by robust educational offerings and faculty expertise in computational fields housed within EECS, the Data Analytics Program, and Mathematics & Statistics. The unique interdisciplinary structure of the School of the Environment 13, bridging CAHNRS and CAS, provides a fertile ground for cross-pollination of ideas and student access to diverse coursework.

Key strengths include a clear focus on application-driven research that addresses pressing societal challenges in agriculture, environmental management, and health, aligning with WSU's land-grant mission and strategic goals.4 This is exemplified by major initiatives like the AgAID AI Institute 96, research on ML for virus prediction 4, and the development of wildfire resilience modeling tools.8 Supporting this research is the accessible and capable Kamiak HPC cluster, centrally managed by CIRC, which provides essential computational power, including vital GPU resources for AI/ML, and a flexible software environment manageable by individual researchers.111 Furthermore, WSU's proactive development of ethical guidelines for generative AI use positions the institution to navigate the complexities of these powerful tools responsibly.126

Opportunities for future growth exist alongside some challenges. While foundational quantitative skills are embedded in natural resource curricula, integrating more advanced AI/ML concepts directly into these programs could further enhance student preparedness. Currently, students require careful planning and initiative to bridge the prerequisite gap between natural resource majors and upper-level computer science courses offering deep AI/ML training. Continued efforts to foster collaboration between computational experts in EECS, Math/Stats, and Data Analytics, and domain scientists in SoE, CAHNRS, and Vet Med will be crucial for tackling increasingly complex interdisciplinary problems. Addressing potential bottlenecks in data storage and management for large-scale computational projects also warrants attention.118

Looking ahead, WSU is well-positioned to solidify its leadership in applying AI and advanced computation to natural resource challenges. Continued investment in interdisciplinary programs, faculty recruitment at the intersection of these fields, and support for research infrastructure like Kamiak will be vital. Leveraging the momentum of initiatives like AgAID and capitalizing on faculty expertise in computational disease ecology, geospatial analysis, and environmental modeling offers pathways to significant impact. By continuing to integrate cutting-edge computational methods with deep domain knowledge in environmental and agricultural sciences, WSU can make substantial contributions to building a more sustainable and resilient future, fulfilling the core tenets of its institutional mission and strategic vision.21
