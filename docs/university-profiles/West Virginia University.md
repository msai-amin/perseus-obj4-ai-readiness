# **West Virginia University**

## **Introduction**

West Virginia University (WVU) is increasingly recognizing and engaging with the transformative potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the domain of natural resource management. The institution's historical strengths in traditional natural resource disciplines, housed primarily within the Davis College of Agriculture, Natural Resources and Design, are now being complemented by burgeoning capabilities in computational sciences across several colleges. This synergy is pivotal as AI and data-intensive methodologies become indispensable for addressing complex environmental challenges, optimizing resource utilization, and advancing scientific understanding. Recent strategic initiatives, including the introduction of new AI-focused academic programs 1 and university-wide dialogues such as the AI Symposium 2, signal a deliberate move towards harnessing these interdisciplinary strengths. WVU possesses a solid foundation, with established natural resource programs 3, a growing cadre of faculty with AI-relevant expertise, dedicated research centers like the Natural Resource Analysis Center (NRAC) 5, and significant investments in high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure tailored for AI and machine learning (ML).6 This report provides a comprehensive analysis of WVU's current academic offerings, research activities, computational infrastructure, strategic planning, and ethical frameworks concerning the application of AI to natural resources, forestry, conservation, and environmental science. The university appears to be at an inflection point, where concerted efforts to integrate its distributed expertise and resources could position it as a significant contributor to AI-driven solutions in the natural resources sector. The successful navigation of this integration, bridging traditional field sciences with advanced computational paradigms, will be crucial for realizing this potential.

## **Academic Foundations for AI in Natural Resources**

### **A. Core Natural Resource Programs: Offerings and Accreditation Status**

The primary locus for natural resource education at WVU is the **Davis College of Agriculture, Natural Resources and Design**. This college offers a comprehensive suite of undergraduate and graduate programs designed to equip students with expertise in various facets of resource management and environmental science.3 Key undergraduate majors include Forest Resources and Conservation; Environment, Soil, and Water Sciences; Wildlife and Fisheries Resources; and Environmental, Energy and Land Management.3 At the graduate level, the Davis College provides Master of Science (M.S.) degrees in Forestry, Wildlife and Fisheries Resources, and an interdisciplinary Master of Agriculture (M.Agr.) in Agriculture, Natural Resources and Design, alongside a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Natural Resources.4

The quality and professional alignment of these programs are underscored by accreditations from relevant national bodies. The **Bachelor of Science in Forestry (B.S.F.)** program, specifically its Forest Management area of emphasis, is accredited by the Society of American Foresters (SAF), the principal accrediting body for forestry education in the United States.4 Furthermore, the Wood Innovation area of emphasis (formerly Sustainable Biomaterials) holds accreditation from the Society of Wood Science and Technology (SWST).4 These accreditations ensure that the curriculum meets rigorous national standards, preparing graduates for professional careers.

The **Wildlife and Fisheries Resources (B.S.)** program is structured to prepare students for professional certification by The Wildlife Society (TWS) and the American Fisheries Society (AFS).12 While the program itself is not accredited by a single overarching body (as no such body exists for general wildlife and fisheries programs 11), its alignment with certification requirements serves as a critical benchmark of educational quality and professional preparedness. Graduates are thus equipped with the knowledge base expected by these leading professional organizations.

The **Recreation, Parks, and Tourism Resources (B.S.)** program is listed by the Council on Accreditation of Parks, Recreation, Tourism and Related Professions (COAPRT) as having "Preliminary Accreditation Applicants" status, with Dr. Steven Selin as the contact.14 This indicates the program is actively pursuing or undergoing the accreditation process. It is important to note that while another source 15 refers to Shepherd University as having the only COAPRT-accredited recreation program in West Virginia, the information in 14 directly pertains to WVU's program. The **Energy Land Management** program within the Davis College is accredited by the American Landman Association (ALA).4

Beyond the Davis College, the **Eberly College of Arts and Sciences** contributes to natural resource-related education through its B.S. in Earth and Environmental Science.16 This program incorporates courses such as "Earth Data Analytics" and "Digital Earth and GIS," signaling a commitment to quantitative and geospatial skill development relevant to contemporary environmental challenges.

The robust accreditation portfolio across several Davis College programs affirms a commitment to high educational standards within traditional natural resource disciplines. This adherence to external benchmarks ensures graduates possess core competencies recognized by professional bodies. However, the structured nature of accreditation requirements can, at times, introduce a degree of curricular inflexibility. As AI and computational sciences rapidly evolve, integrating substantial, cutting-edge AI coursework into already packed, accredited programs can be challenging without either compromising accreditation standards or overburdening students. This presents a dynamic tension between maintaining established professional rigor and embracing new, interdisciplinary computational paradigms. Furthermore, programs like Wildlife and Fisheries, by focusing on certification readiness 12, provide excellent grounding in ecological principles and management practices. Yet, this preparation does not inherently guarantee proficiency in advanced AI or computational techniques unless students proactively seek such skills through elective pathways, minors, or specialized graduate training. Thus, a "certification-ready" graduate may require additional focused education to become "AI-proficient" in the context of natural resource management.

### **B. Supporting Computational and Data Science Programs**

The foundational expertise in AI, machine learning, statistics, and data science at WVU is primarily concentrated within the **Statler College of Engineering and Mineral Resources** and the **Eberly College of Arts and Sciences**.

The **Statler College of Engineering and Mineral Resources** houses the **Lane Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering (LCSEE)**. LCSEE is central to WVU's AI and ML capabilities, offering a spectrum of B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. programs in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Cybersecurity.18 The department's research portfolio explicitly includes AI, ML, big data, and computer vision 18, and its faculty roster demonstrates significant expertise in these areas, including data science and high-performance computing.21

The **Eberly College of Arts and Sciences** plays a crucial role through its **School of Mathematical and Data Sciences** and the **Department of Statistics**. The School of Mathematical and Data Sciences offers a B.S. in Data Science, an explicitly interdisciplinary program rooted in applied mathematics, statistics, and computer science.17 It also offers M.S. and Ph.D. programs in Mathematics, which include applied mathematics tracks and faculty research in the mathematical foundations of data science and machine learning.23 The Department of Statistics provides undergraduate and graduate programs (including an M.S. in Statistics) 17, delivering the foundational and advanced statistical knowledge essential for data analysis, machine learning, and AI.

Additionally, the **John Chambers College of Business and Economics** contributes to the data science landscape at WVU with an M.S. in Business Data Analytics 31 and a Graduate Certificate in Business Data Science.32 While these programs are business-oriented, they expand the university's overall data science educational offerings and could provide relevant coursework or collaborative expertise for certain natural resource applications, particularly those involving economic modeling or resource optimization.

The distribution of AI and data science academic programs and expertise across Statler College, Eberly College, and Chambers College indicates a broad institutional engagement with these fields. This multi-college involvement offers a diversity of perspectives and approaches to AI, which can be a strength. However, it also necessitates robust inter-college coordination and clearly defined pathways if natural resource students and researchers are to effectively leverage these distributed resources. Without such coordination, there is a risk of siloed efforts and administrative complexities for individuals seeking interdisciplinary training or collaborations.

A significant development is the establishment of dedicated data science programs, most notably the B.S. in Data Science within the Eberly College 24 and the M.S. in Business Data Analytics in the Chambers College.31 The B.S. in Data Science program is particularly noteworthy for its explicit design allowing students to select a "focus area" in a discipline of their choice, with examples including GIS, biology, and geology.24 This structure provides a direct and integrated pathway for students to combine rigorous data science training with substantial domain knowledge in natural resources, creating a graduate profile uniquely suited for the intersection of these fields.

This consolidated view of WVU's academic landscape reveals a distributed but growing capacity for AI applications in natural resources. The challenge and opportunity lie in effectively connecting these diverse programs and expertise to create synergistic educational and research outcomes.

## **Curricular Integration of AI, Data Science, and Computational Methods**

### **A. Quantitative and Geospatial Skills within Natural Resource Majors (Davis College)**

The curricula within the Davis College of Agriculture, Natural Resources and Design incorporate foundational quantitative, statistical, and geospatial skills to varying degrees across its majors, providing a baseline of computational literacy for students.

In **Forest Resources Management (BSF)**, students encounter several courses with significant quantitative and computational components. FNRS 222 (Forest Mensuration) introduces statistical techniques for forest inventory.10 A critical early course is FNRS 240 & 240L (Introduction to Computing in Natural Resources), which serves as an initial exposure to computational tools and methods relevant to the field.35 Geospatial skills are addressed in FNRS 326 (Remote Sensing of Environment), focusing on imagery interpretation.35 Economic aspects involving quantitative methods are covered in FNRS 330 (Principles of Forestry Economics) 10, and decision-making tools like simulation modeling and linear programming are part of FNRS 362 (Forest Product Decision-Making).36 A foundational statistics course, typically STAT 211 (Elementary Statistical Inference), is also a common requirement.35 Students in the Forest Ecosystem Science and Sustainability area of emphasis have access to electives like GEOG 457 (Open-Source Spatial Analytics) and RESM 545 (Spatial Hydrology and Watershed Analysis), offering pathways to more advanced analytical skills.35

The **Wildlife and Fisheries Resources (B.S.)** program mandates foundational mathematics (MATH 124\) and statistics (STAT 211).13 A key "Quantitative Requirement" allows students to choose from courses such as MATH 150 (Applied Calculus), STAT 312 (Intermediate Statistical Methods), WMAN 411 (Introduction to Quantitative Ecology), or RESM 440 & 440L (Foundations of Applied Geographic Information Systems).13 This elective structure means students can opt into GIS training. WMAN 300 (Wildlife and Fisheries Techniques) requires STAT 211 and RESM 440 as prerequisites or corequisites, emphasizing scientific evaluation.36 Ecological modeling concepts are introduced in WMAN 313 (Wildlife Ecosystem Ecology) 12, and WMAN 411 (Introduction to Quantitative Ecology) focuses specifically on the analysis of fish and wildlife data.13 Notably, at the graduate level (M.S./Ph.D.) in Wildlife and Fisheries Resources, students typically undertake two semesters of advanced statistics (STAT 511 and 512\) and an advanced GIS course, indicating a strong emphasis on quantitative research skills at this level.37

For the **Environmental, Soil, and Water Sciences (B.S.)** major, RESM 440 (Foundations of Applied Geographic Information Systems) is highlighted as a popular course, indicating an integration of GIS technology.39 The curriculum emphasizes interdisciplinary training in environmental protection sciences.39 The Natural Resource Analysis Center (NRAC) lists several resource management (RESM) courses they are involved in teaching, including RESM 440, RESM 441 (Applied GIS in Natural Sciences), RESM 540 (Geospatial Modeling), RESM 545 (Spatial Hydrology), and RESM 575 (Spatial Analysis), suggesting these are available and relevant to students in environmental science fields.40

Across these Davis College majors, there is a discernible effort to include foundational statistics (often STAT 211\) and at least an option for introductory GIS (typically RESM 440). However, the depth of engagement with more advanced computational or modeling techniques can vary significantly based on the specific major, the student's choice of emphasis or electives, and whether they pursue graduate studies. For instance, while Forest Resources Management appears to embed more quantitative and remote sensing courses directly into its core 35, Wildlife and Fisheries Resources offers GIS as one option among several for a quantitative methods requirement 13, implying some students might not gain substantial GIS exposure at the undergraduate level unless they specifically choose it or related electives. The explicit requirement for advanced statistics and GIS in the Wildlife and Fisheries graduate programs underscores the recognized need for these skills for advanced research and practice.37

The presence of FNRS 240 & 240L (Introduction to Computing in Natural Resources) 35 within the Forest Resources Management curriculum represents a potentially pivotal early touchpoint. The content, software, and analytical paradigms introduced in such a course can significantly shape students' preparedness and inclination to pursue more advanced computational topics, including AI and data science. If this course primarily covers basic software proficiency, it may be a missed opportunity. Conversely, if it introduces scripting (e.g., in R or Python), fundamental data manipulation techniques, and an overview of how data analytics and modeling can address complex natural resource problems, it could serve as a powerful gateway, inspiring students to seek further specialized training.

### **B. Advanced AI, Machine Learning, and Data Science Coursework: Availability and Accessibility for Natural Resource Students**

WVU offers a range of advanced coursework in AI, Machine Learning (ML), High-Performance Computing (HPC), and Data Science, primarily through the Lane Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering (LCSEE) in the Statler College and the School of Mathematical and Data Sciences in the Eberly College. However, the accessibility of these courses to students from natural resource backgrounds is a key consideration due to differing prerequisite pathways.

Within the **LCSEE (Statler College)**, undergraduate students can access CS 472 (Artificial Intelligence), which covers AI techniques, search algorithms, knowledge representation, natural language processing, and neural networks.41 Other relevant upper-level undergraduate courses include CPE 453 (Data and Computer Communications) and CS 420 (Design of Algorithms).41 At the graduate level (M.S. and Ph.D. in Computer Science), a suite of specialized AI/ML courses is available, including CPE 520 (Application of Neural Networks), CPE 620 (Deep Learning), CS 560 (Big Data Engineering), CS 573 (Advanced Data Mining), CS 676 (Machine Learning), CS 677 (Pattern Recognition), and CS 678 (Computer Vision).42 The M.S. in Computer Science program even offers an Area of Emphasis in Computational Data Science, incorporating several of these courses.42 However, admission to these graduate CS programs, and indeed many advanced undergraduate CS courses, typically requires a strong foundation in computer science (e.g., data structures, algorithms, operating systems, discrete mathematics – CS 111, CS 220, CS 310, CS 320, CS 330, CS 350\) and advanced mathematics (calculus, linear algebra, probability and statistics).44 This extensive background often poses a significant "prerequisite barrier" for students graduating from traditional natural resource programs, whose curricula, while including basic math and stats, do not typically cover the breadth and depth of CS theory required.

The **School of Mathematical and Data Sciences (Eberly College)** offers a more direct bridge for interdisciplinary AI/data science engagement, particularly through its **B.S. in Data Science**. This program is intentionally interdisciplinary, integrating core computer science courses (CS 110, CS 111, CS 320), mathematics and statistics courses (MATH 155, 156, 251, 303, 441; STAT 215, 312, 445), and a dedicated Data Science core.25 The Data Science core includes DSCI 101 (Introduction to Data Science), DSCI 221 (Reproducible Data Science using R), DSCI 222 (Data Science Workflows using Python), DSCI 310 & DSCI 311 (Statistical Machine Learning 1 & 2), DSCI 410 (Big Data in Practice: Cloud and Parallel Computing), DSCI 450 (Current Topics in Data Science), and DSCI 480 (Capstone in Data Science).25 Courses like DSCI 309 (Applied Machine Learning) and DSCI 409 (Advanced Case Studies in Data Science, covering HPC, NLP, streaming data, and imaging) further strengthen the applied ML focus.45 A crucial feature of this B.S. program is the requirement for students to select a concentration in a discipline of their choice, such as Biology, Geography, or GIS.24 This structure is strategically designed to produce graduates who possess both robust data science capabilities and substantive domain knowledge, making them well-suited for applying AI in natural resource contexts.

Graduate offerings in the School of Mathematical and Data Sciences include M.S. and Ph.D. programs in Mathematics, with faculty research interests in "Emerging Applications of Machine Learning" and "Mathematical Foundations of Data Science".26 Relevant courses include MATH 521 (Numerical Analysis) and MATH 563 (Mathematical Modeling).27 The Department of Statistics offers graduate courses such as STAT 523 (Statistical Computing with R), STAT 541 (Applied Multivariate Analysis), STAT 543 (Bioinformatics Data Analysis), STAT 545 (Applied Regression Analysis), and STAT 745 (Data Mining, covering predictive models like trees and neural networks).27 These statistics courses generally require foundational statistics (e.g., STAT 511, 512\) as prerequisites, making them more accessible to natural resource graduates with a solid statistical background.

This landscape suggests varying levels of AI engagement for natural resource students. An "AI-lite" approach, involving the application of existing AI-driven tools or models, might be accessible through advanced GIS courses with modeling components (e.g., RESM 540 Geospatial Modeling 34) or quantitative ecology courses (e.g., WMAN 411 13). However, a "deep dive" into AI theory, algorithm development, and advanced ML model creation would likely necessitate pursuing the B.S. in Data Science, a relevant minor, or substantial cross-departmental graduate coursework, often contingent on overcoming the aforementioned prerequisite challenges in computer science. The B.S. in Data Science, with its disciplinary concentration, stands out as a key interdisciplinary bridge, potentially producing graduates more immediately prepared for the AI-natural resources nexus than those from traditional, siloed programs.

### **C. Specialized Minors and Certificates in GIS, Data Analytics, and Related Fields**

WVU offers several specialized undergraduate minors and graduate certificates that provide focused training in GIS, data analytics, and related computational methods, serving as valuable pathways for specialization for natural resource students.

A flagship offering is the **Graduate Certificate in Geographic Information Systems and Spatial Analysis**, jointly administered by the Davis College of Agriculture, Natural Resources and Design and the Eberly College of Arts and Sciences.33 This 15-credit certificate, available fully online, is designed to equip students and professionals with skills in predictive modeling, data exploration, programming, spatial hydrology, remote sensing, and geospatial modeling.33 The curriculum includes courses such as GEOG 550 (Geographic Information Science), RESM 540 (Geospatial Modeling), RESM 545 (Spatial Hydrology), RESM 575 (Advanced Spatial Analysis), and a capstone independent study (RESM 585).33 Admission requirements—a bachelor's degree (or associate's, or junior standing with a 3.0 GPA for current undergraduates), a 2.8 overall GPA, introductory statistics (STAT 211 equivalent), and a recommended introductory GIS course (RESM 440 or GEOG 350 equivalent)—make this certificate relatively accessible to individuals with a foundational background in natural resources and basic quantitative skills.33 This certificate is a highly strategic asset for WVU, providing a direct route for upskilling in advanced geospatial data analysis.

At the undergraduate level, students can pursue several minors to complement their primary field of study. The **Eberly College's Department of Geology and Geography** offers a minor in **Geography: Geographic Information Science (GIS)** 47, providing a direct path for specialization in geospatial technologies. The **School of Mathematical and Data Sciences (Eberly College)** offers minors in **Data Science** and **Statistics** 17, enabling students from natural resource majors to formally build a strong computational and analytical skillset. The **Davis College** itself offers a range of minors, including Conservation Ecology, Forest Resources Management, and Environmental Protection.48 While these do not explicitly focus on AI or data science, they can be strategically combined with a Data Science major or a computationally focused minor from another college to create a powerful interdisciplinary profile. The School of Natural Resources and the Environment (within Davis College) also lists minors such as Arboriculture and Wildlife and Fisheries Resources.49

Other graduate certificates that may hold relevance include:

* The **Graduate Certificate in Applied Biostatistics**, offered by the School of Public Health, is a 15-credit online program focusing on statistical methods for health and medical research, including database management and regression analysis, culminating in a data analysis project.50 This could be pertinent for natural resource students focusing on ecological health, disease ecology, or environmental epidemiology.  
* The **Graduate Certificate in Business Data Science**, from the John Chambers College of Business and Economics, is a 12-credit hour program covering advanced analytical methods, machine learning, and data mining, albeit with a business orientation.32  
* The **Lane Department (Statler College)** offers graduate certificates in Software Engineering and Computer Forensics 20, which are less directly aligned with natural resource AI but contribute to the university's overall computational training capacity.

The availability of these minors and certificates, particularly the GIS, Data Science, and Statistics minors at the undergraduate level, and the GIS and Spatial Analysis Graduate Certificate, allows for considerable flexibility in tailoring a student's education. However, successfully navigating these interdisciplinary pathways, especially when they involve crossing college boundaries, depends heavily on proactive student planning and well-informed academic advising. Students and advisors must recognize the value of these computational specializations and map out coursework effectively.

While these offerings provide components of AI-relevant education, there is no explicitly branded "AI in Natural Resources" minor or certificate currently listed at either the undergraduate or graduate level, aside from the concentration options within the broader B.S. in Data Science. A more targeted credential, such as a "Graduate Certificate in AI for Environmental Monitoring" or an "Undergraduate Minor in Computational Ecology," could offer a clearer, more attractive pathway for students specifically interested in this nexus and could represent a future avenue for program development at WVU.

## **Faculty Expertise and Research at the AI-Natural Resources Nexus**

### **A. Leading Researchers and Laboratories in AI Applications for Environmental and Natural Resource Sciences**

Identifying specific faculty and research groups at the forefront of applying AI to natural resource challenges at WVU requires looking across several colleges and centers. While a dedicated "AI in Natural Resources Institute" may not be formally established, pockets of relevant expertise and ongoing research are evident.

Within the **Davis College of Agriculture, Natural Resources and Design**, particularly its Division of Forestry & Natural Resources, research spans areas like watershed management, climate-smart forestry, and habitat restoration.4 While AI is not explicitly mentioned for all these areas, the complexity of topics like "climate-smart forestry" inherently lends itself to data-intensive modeling and AI-driven decision support. Dr. Steve Chhin is noted as a contact for natural resource programs and may be a source for identifying faculty engaged in computational approaches.4

The **Lane Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering (LCSEE) in the Statler College** is a significant hub of AI and ML expertise. Several faculty members have research interests directly or indirectly applicable to natural resources:

* Dr. Anurag Srivastava's work on physics-aware machine learning, though currently applied to power systems, represents an advanced ML technique with high transferability to ecological systems modeling.21  
* Dr. Gianfranco Doretto specializes in computer vision, statistical pattern recognition, and image processing 22, all highly relevant for analyzing remote sensing data, drone imagery, or camera trap footage in ecological studies. He also presented on "syGlass: Experiencing Your Data in Virtual Reality" at the WVU AI Symposium, suggesting expertise in advanced data visualization.2  
* Dr. Frances Van Scoy's background includes high-performance computing 22, a critical enabler for large-scale AI models.

* Adjunct faculty such as Dr. Omid Dehzangi (AI, big data, data mining), Dr. Victor Fragoso (computer vision, machine learning), and Dr. Bin Liu (data mining, machine learning) further augment the department's AI capabilities.21 Teaching Assistant Professor Tom Devine also lists data science and machine learning as expertise.21 The department's broader research activities encompass AI, ML, biometrics, computer vision, and big data visualization.18

The **School of Mathematical and Data Sciences (Eberly College)** contributes through faculty research in applied mathematics, data science, and statistics.23 Specific research areas highlighted include "Emerging Applications of Machine Learning" and "Mathematical Foundations of Data Science".26 Dr. Kenneth Ryan's work in semi-supervised learning is an example of relevant ML research.24

The **Natural Resource Analysis Center (NRAC)**, housed in the Davis College, stands out for its applied research. NRAC's faculty and staff, including Director Paul Kinder and Associate Director for Research Michael Strager, possess expertise in landscape analysis, watershed modeling, remote sensing (LiDAR, drones), and spatial decision support.5 Crucially, NRAC has undertaken projects that explicitly use machine learning, such as the "Development of a Spatially Explicit Surface Coal Mining Predictive Model" which employed a Random Forest algorithm.51 This demonstrates practical application of ML in an environmental context.

Participants in the **WVU AI Symposium 2025** also indicate relevant expertise on campus, such as Dr. David Mebane ("Physics-Informed Machine Learning") and Dr. Aldo Romero (Director of Research Computing).2

This distributed expertise highlights "pockets of excellence." Faculty in LCSEE and specific projects within NRAC demonstrate existing AI/ML applications relevant to natural resources. Individuals like Dr. Romero and Dr. Strager likely function as important connectors between computational capabilities and domain-specific challenges. The presence of adjunct faculty in LCSEE with explicit AI/ML expertise 21 also represents a potentially valuable resource for interdisciplinary projects, as they may bring industry or external perspectives that could spark novel applied research in natural resources. Furthermore, foundational AI fields like "physics-informed machine learning" and "computer vision," where WVU has demonstrated strength 2, are highly transferable and offer significant potential for innovative applications in ecological modeling, environmental monitoring, and resource management.

### **B. Interdisciplinary Research Initiatives and Collaborations**

Several existing structures and initiatives at WVU facilitate or have the potential to foster interdisciplinary research bridging AI and computational sciences with natural resource disciplines.

The **Natural Resource Analysis Center (NRAC)** is a prime example of an established interdisciplinary hub. Its mission is inherently multidisciplinary, focusing on geospatially-based solutions for environmental and natural resource issues.5 NRAC not only conducts collaborative research, such as the predictive modeling project using Random Forest 51, but also contributes to interdisciplinary education by offering GIS and remote sensing courses utilized by students from various departments.40

The **Graduate Certificate in Geographic Information Systems and Spatial Analysis**, a joint offering from the Davis College and the Eberly College 33, is another important interdisciplinary mechanism. By bringing together students and faculty from natural resource backgrounds and geography/geospatial science, it inherently promotes cross-disciplinary learning and potential research collaborations at the graduate level.

The **WVU AI Symposium** serves as a university-wide platform for showcasing AI applications and fostering dialogue among researchers from diverse fields.2 While not exclusively focused on natural resources, its inclusion of topics like "Physics-Informed Machine Learning" and sessions on "AI for Smart and Secure Systems" creates opportunities for natural resource researchers to connect with AI experts and explore potential applications.

Strategic plans at the college level also indicate an intent to foster such collaborations. The **Davis College's 2022 Planning Guide** mentions a "Large Rivers Initiative" aimed at developing science for socio-ecological management through broad WVU interactions.52 The **Statler College's Research Strategic Plan** explicitly identifies "Sustainable Extraction and Utilization of Natural Resources," including "petroleum and natural gas engineering data analytics," and "Robotics" with agricultural applications as key interdisciplinary research areas.53 This plan also emphasizes building partnerships and nurturing an interdisciplinary culture.

NRAC's established role in applied geospatial analysis and its demonstrated use of machine learning techniques position it as a key existing interdisciplinary entity.5 Its educational contributions further solidify its role as a nexus for students and researchers interested in spatial data science. The strategic intentions laid out in college-level plans, particularly Statler's explicit mention of data analytics in natural resource contexts 53, are positive indicators. However, the translation of these intentions into tangible, funded research programs and robust support mechanisms for cross-college collaboration will be crucial for their success. Events like the AI Symposium 2 are valuable for initiating dialogue and connections, but their long-term impact on sustained interdisciplinary research will depend on follow-up actions, such as seed funding for collaborative projects or workshops focused on specific AI applications in natural resources. Without such sustained support, these initiatives risk remaining isolated events rather than catalysts for ongoing programmatic development.

## **WVU's Computational Infrastructure for Advanced AI Research**

### **A. High-Performance Computing (HPC) Capabilities, GPU Resources, and AI/ML Software Support**

West Virginia University provides significant central research computing infrastructure, crucial for supporting computationally intensive AI research in natural resources and other fields. The university operates several High-Performance Computing (HPC) clusters, with Thorny Flat being a primary resource.6

**Thorny Flat** is a substantial cluster featuring 159 compute nodes, a total of 6,196 CPU cores, and 10.2TB of aggregated RAM. Critically for AI and ML workloads, it includes 155 GPU cards, comprising various NVIDIA models such as P6000, RTX6000, and high-end A100s, which together provide 771,360 aggregated CUDA cores and 5TB of aggregated GPU memory.6 Another cluster, **Dolly Sods**, offers 34 compute nodes and 1,184 CPU cores 6, likely serving as a supplementary or older system.

Collectively, WVU's "current HPC cluster" (predominantly Thorny Flat) consists of 178 compute nodes with a total of 8,344 CPU cores. Of these, 79 are designated as community nodes, offering 4,824 CPU cores, 9.3 Terabytes of RAM, and 18 NVIDIA P6000 GPUs. The remaining 99 nodes are faculty or department-purchased, contributing an additional 3,520 cores and 29 more NVIDIA GPUs (ranging from RTX6000 to A100s). These purchased nodes are also made available to the broader research community in four-hour increments to maximize utilization.6

A highly significant development was the planned deployment in 2023 of a **new cluster specifically focused on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**. This state-of-the-art system includes 6:

* 30 nodes, each with 32 CPU cores and four NVIDIA A30 GPUs.  
* 4 nodes, each with 32 CPU cores and four NVIDIA A40 GPUs.  
* 2 nodes, each with 64 CPU cores and eight NVIDIA SXM A100 GPUs.  
* 1 node with three NVIDIA A40 GPUs dedicated to visualization and testing. All nodes in this new AI/ML cluster are interconnected with a high-speed, low-latency HDR100 Infiniband fabric, essential for tightly coupled multi-GPU and multi-node distributed training tasks common in advanced AI research.6 This targeted investment underscores WVU's commitment to providing the specialized hardware required for cutting-edge AI.

In terms of **storage**, the HPC facilities offer over 500 TB of data storage accessible for processing within the clusters. Researchers also have the option to purchase group storage. Additionally, WVU provides the centrally managed "Research Data Depot" for cost-effective, long-term storage of research data (though this is not intended for protected or regulated data).6

While specific AI/ML software stacks (e.g., Python, R, TensorFlow, PyTorch) are not explicitly enumerated in the available documentation for the HPC systems 6, the context of a dedicated AI/ML cluster and the stated support for "computationally-intensive research" strongly implies that common scientific computing libraries and widely-used AI/ML frameworks would be supported and maintained by the Research Computing team, led by Director Aldo Humberto Romero.6

WVU also offers tiered HPC services catering to different research needs 54:

* **WVU HPC:** General-use services for low to medium-risk data, available for both funded and unfunded research at no cost. This is the primary resource for most natural resource AI projects.  
* **WVCTSI HPC:** HIPAA-compliant services for funded research involving Protected Health Information (PHI), also at no cost. This is less likely to be used for typical natural resource data unless there's a human health component (e.g., environmental epidemiology).  
* **NIST 800-171/CMMC/FISMA HPC Services:** For research involving controlled unclassified information. WVU does not provide this directly; researchers needing such an environment must obtain estimates and include costs in their proposals.

The development and deployment of the new AI/ML-focused cluster, equipped with high-end NVIDIA A30, A40, and A100 GPUs and fast interconnects 6, represents a significant strategic investment by WVU. This advanced hardware directly enables researchers, including those in natural resources, to tackle more complex AI models, such as deep learning for large-scale image analysis (e.g., from remote sensing or drone surveys) or sophisticated simulations of ecological systems. The tiered access model, particularly the provision of free community nodes on Thorny Flat and the no-cost general-use WVU HPC service 6, is also noteworthy. This approach lowers the barrier to entry for researchers, including those in fields like natural resources who may not always have large grants dedicated solely to computational resources or who are just beginning to explore AI methodologies.

### **B. Access Policies for Researchers and Students**

Access to WVU's research computing resources is designed to be relatively broad, supporting a wide range of researchers and students. A key policy is the provision of free access to community nodes on the HPC clusters for researchers at all institutes of higher learning within West Virginia.6 This extends usability beyond WVU's own faculty and students.

Individual researchers or departments at WVU can also purchase their own dedicated nodes within the HPC environment. These purchased nodes are primarily for the owner's use but are integrated into the shared system and become available to the general community on a first-come, first-served basis during periods when they are not being utilized by the owner, typically in four-hour increments.6 This policy maximizes the utilization of all available computational resources.

The general-use WVU HPC services are accessible for both funded and unfunded research projects, provided the data is classified as low to medium-risk, and these services are offered at no cost to the user.54 Comprehensive HPC documentation is available, and the Research Computing team, including system administrators and software specialists, provides user support.6

This open access policy, particularly the extension of free community node access to all higher education institutions in West Virginia 6, has the potential to act as a catalyst for inter-institutional and interdisciplinary collaboration. It positions WVU as a central computational hub for the state, enabling researchers from smaller colleges or those with unique local datasets (e.g., specific ecological data relevant to natural resource studies) to partner with WVU's computational scientists and leverage its advanced AI infrastructure. This can broaden the impact of WVU's investments and foster a more vibrant statewide research ecosystem in computationally intensive fields.

## **Strategic Imperatives: AI and Data Science in University and College Planning**

### **A. Institutional Vision for AI and Data-Intensive Research**

West Virginia University is demonstrating a clear institutional vision for advancing its capabilities in Artificial Intelligence and data-intensive research, evidenced by high-level strategic decisions and initiatives. A significant indicator of this vision was the WVU Board of Governors' (BOG) approval in April 2025 of new AI-focused academic programs.1 These include a Bachelor of Science in Applied Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics, designed to train students in the use, development, deployment, evaluation, and maintenance of AI and data analytics tools within organizations, and a Master of AI Science in Marketing.1 According to Brad Price, Chair of the Department of Management Information Systems and Supply Chain, these programs are intended to address the "rapidly increasing demand for AI-related talents within the workforce" and position WVU to "lead the way in a field that will set trajectories for economies worldwide".1 This top-down endorsement from the BOG signifies a strong, strategic commitment to cultivating AI talent and fostering research in this domain.

Further evidence of this institutional direction is the organization of events like the WVU AI Symposium 2025\.2 Such symposia aim to convene researchers and practitioners from diverse fields—including healthcare, scientific discovery, and other emerging areas—to highlight cutting-edge AI applications and stimulate critical discussions about the future of AI. These events serve as important platforms for fostering an interdisciplinary AI ecosystem within the university and encouraging collaboration across traditional academic boundaries.

The primary drivers for WVU's AI strategy, as articulated in relation to the new academic programs, appear to be economic and workforce development.1 While this focus is crucial for meeting societal needs and ensuring graduates are well-prepared for the evolving job market, it also implies that applications of AI in fields with less direct or immediate commercial outcomes, such as fundamental ecological research or conservation, may require deliberate advocacy and strategic framing. Proponents of AI in natural resources will need to articulate the value of their work in terms that align with these broader institutional goals or secure dedicated funding that supports research with long-term environmental and societal benefits.

### **B. Alignment of AI Initiatives with Natural Resource Programmatic Goals (College-Level Strategic Plans)**

The strategic plans of individual colleges provide further insight into how university-level AI initiatives might align with or support programmatic goals in natural resources and related computational fields.

The **Davis College of Agriculture, Natural Resources and Design**, in its 2022 Planning Guide (covering FY21-FY24), emphasized student recruitment and retention, critical program evaluation, and overall research growth.52 The plan included goals for expanding online program offerings, with a target of launching two certificates, four bachelor's programs, and two master's programs online within a three-year period. It also highlighted a "Large Rivers Initiative" aimed at developing science to support socio-ecological management and decision-making, actively seeking collaboration across WVU.52 While this 2022 plan did not explicitly name "AI" or "data science" as standalone strategic priorities, its emphasis on research growth, enhanced decision-making support, and the development of online programs creates avenues through which AI and data science education and research could be integrated. The lack of explicit AI terminology in this particular planning document might suggest that AI integration was either subsumed under broader research objectives at that time or that its prominence as a distinct strategic theme for the college has emerged more recently, in line with the university-wide AI push.

The **Statler College of Engineering and Mineral Resources** demonstrates a clearer and more direct strategic link to data analytics within natural resource-related domains in its Research Strategic Plan (targeting 2026).53 This plan aims to expand innovation and collaborative research, identifying several key themes. Notably, "Sustainable Extraction and Utilization of Natural Resources" is listed, with a specific mention of "petroleum and natural gas engineering data analytics." Another relevant theme is "Robotics," with potential applications in agriculture, a field closely allied with natural resources. The plan also underscores the college's commitment to hiring outstanding faculty, attracting exceptional graduate students, improving visibility, building partnerships, and nurturing an interdisciplinary research culture.53 This explicit inclusion of data analytics in a natural resource context within Statler's strategic vision provides a strong foundation for collaborations with the Davis College.

The **Eberly College of Arts and Sciences**' 2020 Strategic Plan for the Future (last updated in 2016\) outlined broad goals such as increasing interdisciplinary approaches and emphasizing critical thinking and communication skills.55 A more recent 2023-2024 Planning Report from Eberly College, seemingly a research-focused internal document, offers critical perspectives on the institutional environment for research.56 It recommends strengthening investment in graduate and undergraduate education, including more robust graduate student stipends. Significantly, it voices concerns about the potential impact of the university's new tuition-driven budget model on research productivity and the viability of graduate programs. The report suggests that an overemphasis on undergraduate student credit hour generation could increase teaching workloads, thereby reducing faculty time for research, and might also complicate the capacity to offer specialized graduate programs that are essential for interdisciplinary fields. It points out, for example, that reductions in foundational programs like World Languages or Mathematics could have cascading negative effects on graduate education across the college, as students in fields like History (and, by extension, potentially interdisciplinary natural resource fields) rely on such offerings for essential skills.56 These observations from within Eberly College highlight potential systemic challenges that could affect WVU's broader ambitions in complex, interdisciplinary research areas like AI in natural resources if not carefully managed. Successful AI integration will depend on a supportive ecosystem that values specialized graduate training and provides faculty with the resources and time for deep, collaborative research.

## **Key Research Centers, Flagship Projects, and Collaborative Ventures**

### **A. Profile of Major Research Centers**

Several research centers at WVU are either directly engaged in or possess high potential for AI-driven natural resource research.

The Natural Resource Analysis Center (NRAC), housed within the Davis College and established in 1990, is a key entity.5 NRAC's mission is to provide geospatially-based research, teaching, and service focused on environmental and natural resource issues. Its areas of expertise include landscape analysis, watershed modeling, remote sensing (utilizing LiDAR and drones), spatial decision support systems, energy issues, and economic development.5 NRAC is actively involved in teaching GIS and remote sensing courses such as FOR 326, RESM 440, and RESM 540, which are foundational for applying AI to spatial data.40  
NRAC's project portfolio demonstrates its capacity for advanced data analysis. Notable projects include:

* Monitoring aquatic physical habitat using drones.  
* Utilizing thermal imagery from drones for prescribed burn analysis at the WVU Research Forest.  
* Employing drone-based LiDAR for conservation planning (Clover Run Conservation).  
* Supporting stream restoration and fish passage projects (Upper Shavers Fork).  
* The Southern Coalfields LiDAR Project, providing high-resolution elevation data for various applications.  
* Developing GIS-based alternative futures models for mountaintop mining regions.  
* Crucially, the "Development of a Spatially Explicit Surface Coal Mining Predictive Model" explicitly used a **Random Forest predictive model**, a machine learning technique, combined with GIS spatial analysis and econometric regression.51  
* Developing the Watershed Characterization and Modeling System (WCMS) in partnership with the WV Department of Environmental Protection.51 This track record, particularly the use of machine learning in predictive modeling, positions NRAC as a de facto hub for applied geospatial AI in natural resources at WVU. Its ongoing projects and educational role make it a critical asset for advancing AI in this domain.

Other WVU centers with potential for AI application in natural resource contexts include 57:

* **WVU Center for Sustainable Biomaterials & Bioenergy (CSBio):** Focuses on developing advanced technologies that promote agricultural and forest resource utilization. AI could be applied here for optimizing biomass conversion processes, predicting crop or forest yields under varying conditions, or designing novel bio-based materials through computational methods.  
* **Appalachian Hardwood Center (AHC):** Connected with the Forest Resources Management program 10, this center concentrates on hardwood utilization. Potential AI applications include automated log grading, optimizing sawmill operations, predicting timber quality, or analyzing hardwood market trends.  
* **WVU Center for Innovation in Gas Research and Utilization (CIGRU):** Conducts research in gas, oil, and chemical fields.57 Given the Statler College's strategic interest in "petroleum and natural gas engineering data analytics" 53, CIGRU could be a site for AI applications in subsurface modeling, drilling optimization, or environmental impact assessment related to energy extraction.

While centers like CSBio and AHC deal with complex biological systems and production processes ripe for AI-driven enhancements, their current level of AI engagement is not explicitly detailed in the available information. This suggests an opportunity to introduce and integrate AI methodologies more deeply into their research programs, potentially through collaborations with NRAC or departments with core AI expertise.

### **B. Notable Externally Funded Projects (NSF, USDA) and Partnerships**

Detailed information on specific externally funded projects from major agencies like the National Science Foundation (NSF) or the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) that explicitly link AI with natural resource applications at WVU was not accessible through the provided research materials.58 This data scarcity represents a limitation in fully assessing the scale and focus of WVU's grant-funded AI-natural resource research. Such grants are typically key indicators of research leadership, faculty expertise, and institutional commitment in specific domains.

However, indirect mentions suggest ongoing efforts to secure funding and build partnerships:

* The Davis College's 2022 Planning Guide expressed a desire for "large sustaining funding on multiple fronts addressing regional, national and international rivers and issues" for its Large Rivers Initiative.52  
* The Statler College's research strategic plan emphasizes building partnerships as a key objective.53  
* The Lane Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering (LCSEE) reports industry partnerships in areas such as big data, AI, and ML 18, although the extent to which these specifically target natural resource applications is unclear.  
* Several of NRAC's projects imply external collaborations or funding sources. For example, its work on the "Alternative Futures for the Mountaintop Removal-Valley Fill Mining Region" and the "Development of a Spatially Explicit Surface Coal Mining Predictive Model" for the Appalachian Landscape Conservation Cooperative likely involved external partners.51  
* NRAC's development of the Watershed Characterization and Modeling System (WCMS) is explicitly a partnership with the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection (WVDEP) 51, demonstrating established state-level collaboration in applying advanced modeling tools to environmental management.

The visible partnership with WVDEP through NRAC is a valuable asset for applied research and addressing state-specific environmental challenges. While LCSEE's industry links in AI are positive 18, they are likely more oriented towards the technology sector. For AI in natural resources to fully flourish, cultivating robust partnerships with federal agencies (e.g., USGS, US Forest Service, EPA), national laboratories, prominent conservation NGOs, and relevant industries (such as forestry technology, precision agriculture, and environmental consulting firms) that are specifically looking to leverage AI will be critical. The current information does not provide strong evidence of numerous, large-scale *AI-specific* partnerships focused directly on natural resource challenges, suggesting an area for potential strategic development.

## **Ethical Considerations and Responsible Conduct in AI Research**

### **A. University Policies and Training on AI Ethics**

The ethical dimensions of Artificial Intelligence are gaining recognition at WVU, as evidenced by discussions within the university community. The WVU AI Symposium 2025 program included dedicated talks on "AI and Ethics" by Amy Cyphert and "Grey AI: AI Advancements in Ethical and Unethical Hacking".2 This indicates an emerging awareness and dialogue surrounding the ethical implications of AI technologies.

However, the provided research materials do not point to a specific, formally adopted university-wide "AI Ethics Policy" document or a structured training program exclusively dedicated to AI ethics that would cover issues such as algorithmic bias, data privacy in large geospatial datasets, the transparency and interpretability of AI models used in environmental decision-making, or the accountability of autonomous systems in resource monitoring. While the inclusion of ethics in the AI Symposium is a positive first step, the development of more formalized institutional guidelines and tailored educational resources on AI ethics may be an area for future development. Such frameworks are increasingly important for ensuring the responsible design, deployment, and governance of AI systems, particularly in sensitive domains like natural resource management where AI applications can have significant societal and environmental equity implications.

### **B. Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) Program Requirements**

West Virginia University has an established framework for ensuring Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR), which applies to all researchers and students, including those involved in AI and natural resource projects. Ethics training is primarily delivered through the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI Program).60 This training is mandatory for all personnel listed on an Institutional Review Board (IRB) protocol and must be renewed every five years. The specific CITI modules required depend on the nature of the research, with distinct courses for Biomedical Research Investigators and Social and Behavioral Research Investigators. IRB members are also required to complete a dedicated CITI course.60

Beyond IRB-mandated training for human subjects research, RCR courses are broadly recommended for all faculty, staff, and students involved in any research and related activities. More stringently, RCR training is a **requirement** for several groups of researchers, including 60:

* Recipients of National Institutes of Health (NIH) training grants.  
* Undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers funded by National Science Foundation (NSF) grants.  
* All project personnel funded by U.S. Department of Agriculture \- National Institute of Food and Agriculture (USDA-NIFA) grants. The requirements for NSF and USDA-NIFA funded personnel are particularly relevant to researchers in natural resources, as these agencies are significant funders in this domain. The WVU Office of Human Research Protections (OHRP) manages access to CITI training records and provides support.60

While WVU's standard RCR framework, delivered via CITI, covers core principles of research integrity such as data management, authorship, conflict of interest, and plagiarism, it may not comprehensively address the unique and rapidly evolving ethical challenges specifically posed by Artificial Intelligence. General RCR modules might not delve deeply into issues like algorithmic bias in environmental models, the implications of using AI for surveillance in conservation, the "black box" nature of some complex AI decision-making processes, or the equitable distribution of benefits and risks from AI applications in resource allocation. Therefore, while the existing RCR program provides an essential foundation, there may be a need to augment this with AI-specific ethics training or modules for researchers and students working at the intersection of AI and natural resources to ensure they are equipped to navigate these nuanced ethical landscapes.

## **Conclusion**

West Virginia University stands at a promising juncture in leveraging Artificial Intelligence for the advancement of natural resource management, conservation, and environmental science. The institution possesses a confluence of foundational strengths in traditional natural resource disciplines, rapidly expanding capabilities in AI and data science, and a clear strategic intent from university leadership to foster innovation in these areas. However, realizing the full potential of this synergy requires addressing existing gaps, strengthening interdisciplinary connections, and proactively navigating the complexities of this dynamic field.

Strengths:  
WVU's primary strengths lie in its well-established natural resource programs within the Davis College, many of which hold professional accreditations, ensuring a solid grounding in domain expertise.3 This is complemented by a growing portfolio of AI and Data Science academic programs in the Statler and Eberly Colleges, most notably the B.S. in Data Science, which is designed with interdisciplinary concentrations in mind.18 The university has made significant investments in High-Performance Computing, including a new AI-specific GPU cluster, providing the necessary hardware for advanced computational research.6 The Natural Resource Analysis Center (NRAC) serves as an active research entity already applying geospatial analysis and machine learning techniques to tangible natural resource challenges.5 Furthermore, a top-down strategic endorsement for AI development from university leadership, evidenced by the approval of new AI-focused degrees 1, creates a supportive institutional climate. The accessible Graduate Certificate in GIS and Spatial Analysis also provides a valuable pathway for upskilling in advanced geospatial data techniques.33  
Weaknesses:  
Despite these strengths, certain weaknesses are apparent. A significant "prerequisite barrier" may hinder natural resource students from accessing advanced AI and computer science courses offered by the Lane Department, due to the extensive CS and mathematics background typically required.44 The Davis College's 2022 strategic plan, while focused on research growth, lacked an explicit AI or data science thrust 52, potentially indicating a need for closer alignment with the university's broader AI strategy. The distributed nature of AI expertise across multiple colleges, while offering diverse perspectives, could lead to siloed efforts if not actively managed through strong inter-college coordination mechanisms. Formal university-wide AI ethics policies and AI-specific ethics training modules appear to be in the nascent stages of development, relying currently on general RCR training and ad-hoc discussions.2 Finally, the visibility of major externally funded AI-Natural Resource grants and extensive industry or federal partnerships specifically focused on this interdisciplinary nexus is limited based on the available information.  
Opportunities:  
Numerous opportunities exist for WVU to enhance its leadership in AI for natural resources. The B.S. in Data Science, with its disciplinary concentration options, can be further leveraged to create a robust pipeline of graduates equipped with dual expertise. Developing targeted "AI for Natural Resources" minors or certificates at both undergraduate and graduate levels could provide clearer and more attractive educational pathways. Investing in NRAC's AI capabilities, perhaps by embedding dedicated AI specialists or fostering joint projects with LCSEE, could transform it into a leading center for AI-driven environmental solutions. Proactive development and promotion of AI ethics guidelines and training tailored to natural resource applications would position WVU as a leader in responsible AI. The new AI/ML HPC cluster is a powerful asset for attracting top research talent and pursuing large-scale, data-intensive projects in areas like climate modeling, biodiversity monitoring, and sustainable resource management. The Davis College's plan for more online offerings 52 could be a vehicle for delivering specialized computational skills training to natural resource professionals regionally and nationally.  
Threats:  
Potential threats include the possibility that budget models prioritizing undergraduate student credit hours, as raised in Eberly College's planning report 56, could inadvertently stifle the time-intensive interdisciplinary research and specialized graduate training essential for AI in natural resources. The rapid pace of AI development may outstrip the ability of traditional departments to adapt curricula or upskill faculty. Competition from other universities with more established or better-funded interdisciplinary AI-Natural Resource programs is also a factor. Finally, an insufficient institutional focus on the ethical implications of AI in this domain could lead to unintended negative consequences or erode public trust.  
The successful integration of AI into natural resource management at WVU hinges critically on **human capital development**. Beyond infrastructure and programs, fostering talent proficient in both natural resource sciences and AI/data science is paramount. This involves not only training new generations of students through programs like the B.S. in Data Science 25 but also providing avenues for existing faculty and researchers to upskill in AI methodologies, perhaps through workshops, collaborative grants, or co-teaching opportunities. Without a concerted effort to build this "bilingual" human capital, the full potential of WVU's computational infrastructure and strategic AI goals may not be realized.

Another crucial, though less visible, enabler will be **data governance and accessibility**. While WVU possesses significant computational power 6 and access to natural resource data through its research forests, NRAC projects 51, and state partnerships, the effective application of AI depends on well-curated, accessible, and interoperable datasets. Establishing robust data governance frameworks, promoting FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data principles, and potentially creating platforms for sharing and annotating natural resource data will be vital for advancing AI research in this domain. This aspect is often underestimated but is fundamental to a successful data-intensive research strategy.

Finally, as WVU advances its AI initiatives 1, it must guard against the risk of superficial adoption of AI terminology—so-called **"AI washing"**—without genuine, deep integration of AI methodologies. True impact comes from using AI to solve previously intractable problems, developing novel AI methods tailored to natural resource complexities, or significantly enhancing decision-making through AI-driven insights. This requires rigorous standards, critical evaluation of AI applications, and a commitment to substantive, rather than merely symbolic, engagement with AI.

**Recommendations:**

To further solidify and expand its role in the application of Artificial Intelligence to Natural Resource Management, West Virginia University could consider the following actionable recommendations:

1. **Establish an Interdisciplinary "AI in Natural Resources" Initiative or Virtual Center:** This initiative would serve as a focal point for collaboration, funding, and visibility, bridging the Davis, Statler, and Eberly Colleges. It could coordinate seed grants, host thematic workshops, and facilitate joint research projects.  
2. **Develop Flexible "Bridge" Programs and Curricular Modules:** Create accessible pathways for natural resource students and faculty to acquire core AI, data science, and computer science skills. This could include short courses, summer bootcamps, or stackable graduate certificates with adjusted prerequisites.  
3. **Invest in Joint Faculty Appointments:** Strategically create joint faculty positions between departments in the Davis College (e.g., Forestry, Wildlife) and departments with core AI/computational expertise (e.g., LCSEE, Mathematical and Data Sciences). This would embed expertise and foster organic collaboration.  
4. **Launch a Targeted Seed Grant Program:** Allocate internal funding specifically for pilot projects that are interdisciplinary, applying AI/ML techniques to solve pressing natural resource challenges relevant to West Virginia and the Appalachian region.  
5. **Develop and Implement University-Wide AI Ethics Guidelines with Specific Attention to Environmental and Societal Impacts:** Supplement existing RCR training with modules and workshops focused on the unique ethical considerations of AI in natural resources, covering data bias, algorithmic transparency, community impact, and responsible innovation.  
6. **Showcase and Promote Success Stories:** Actively publicize successful AI-Natural Resource projects, such as NRAC's predictive modeling work 51 or research leveraging the new AI/ML cluster, to attract prospective students, faculty, and external funding.  
7. **Integrate Foundational Data Science and AI Ethics into Natural Resource Curricula:** Revise core courses within Davis College programs (e.g., FNRS 240 35) to include introductions to data science principles, programming basics (R/Python), and ethical considerations of using data and AI in their field.  
8. **Create a Centralized Repository or Platform for WVU's Natural Resource Data:** Develop infrastructure and policies to make relevant institutional and research-generated natural resource datasets more findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) for AI research, while ensuring appropriate data governance and security.  
9. **Strengthen External Partnerships for AI in Natural Resources:** Proactively seek and cultivate research and educational partnerships with federal agencies (USFS, USGS, EPA, DOE), industry leaders in agriculture technology and environmental consulting, and national conservation organizations that are investing in AI-driven solutions.  
10. **Conduct Regular Strategic Reviews of AI Integration:** Periodically assess the progress of AI integration within natural resource programs and research, ensuring alignment with university strategic goals, addressing emerging challenges (such as those highlighted in the Eberly College report 56), and adapting to the rapidly evolving landscape of AI technology and its applications.

By strategically building upon its existing strengths and proactively addressing these areas for development, West Virginia University can significantly enhance its contributions to the increasingly vital field of Artificial Intelligence in Natural Resource Management.
