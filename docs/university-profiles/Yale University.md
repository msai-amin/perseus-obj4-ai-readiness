## **Academic Programs at the Intersection of Natural Resources and AI**

**A. Yale School of the Environment (YSE) and The Forest School Overview**

The Yale School of the Environment (YSE) serves as the primary locus for graduate-level environmental study and research at Yale University. Its origins trace back to the Yale Forest School, founded in 1900, marking it as the oldest graduate forestry program in the United States.2 In July 2020, the school transitioned from its former name, the Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies, to the Yale School of the Environment. This change signified an expansion to encompass a wider array of environmental interests and disciplines, while strategically maintaining a distinct Forest School within YSE to preserve its historical strengths and focus.2 The Forest School specifically centers its education and research on applied forest ecology and social sciences, addressing sustainable management, the critical link between forests and climate change, and the livelihoods of forest-dependent communities globally.1

**B. Relevant Degree Programs and Specializations**

YSE offers a suite of graduate degrees pertinent to natural resources and environmental science, catering to both professional practice and in-depth research.12 Key programs include:

* **Master of Environmental Management (MEM):** A professional degree designed to prepare students for leadership roles in environmental management and policy across various sectors.2  
* **Master of Environmental Science (MESc):** A research-focused degree intended for students seeking deeper disciplinary focus and aiming to contribute to scientific knowledge.2  
* **Master of Forestry (MF):** A professional degree focused on sustainable natural resource management and policy, particularly within forestry.1  
* **Master of Forest Science (MFS):** A research degree concentrating on scientific inquiry related to forest ecosystems.1  
* **Doctor of Philosophy (PhD):** A five-year, research-intensive program cultivating scholars equipped to address complex environmental challenges.1

Students within these programs can tailor their studies through YSE's "Learning Communities," which function as areas of specialization. Relevant communities include Forestry, Ecosystem Management and Conservation, Climate Change Science and Solutions, Environmental Policy Analysis, and Water Resource Science and Management, among others.12 These communities provide interdisciplinary experiences and networks. Furthermore, YSE offers numerous joint degree programs, allowing students to combine their environmental studies with disciplines such as Law (JD), Management (MBA), Public Health (MPH), Architecture (MArch), Global Affairs (MPP), and others, either within Yale or through partnerships with external institutions like Pace University School of Law and Vermont Law School.2 However, it is noteworthy that the available information does not indicate formal joint degree programs specifically linking YSE graduate programs with the Department of Computer Science (CPSC) or the Department of Statistics & Data Science (S\&DS).14 This contrasts with the availability of joint undergraduate majors between CPSC and other departments (e.g., Economics, Mathematics, Psychology) 15 and combined PhD options involving S\&DS.16

**C. Accreditation Status**

Professional accreditation signifies that a program meets rigorous external standards for educational quality within a specific field. The Yale School of the Environment's two-year Master of Forestry (MF) program holds accreditation from the Society of American Foresters (SAF).17 This accreditation, first received in 1935 3, confirms that the program meets the established standards for professional forestry education in the United States. YSE policy mandates that each MF student's individualized course of study conforms to SAF requirements, with oversight provided by the program coordinator and faculty advisor.17

In contrast, the research conducted for this report found no evidence within the reviewed university materials of program accreditation by The Wildlife Society (TWS) for any YSE programs.3 While YSE offers coursework and faculty expertise relevant to wildlife ecology and conservation 21, formal TWS program accreditation was not documented.

**D. Implications**

The structure and offerings of YSE demonstrate a strong, historically grounded, and professionally accredited foundation, particularly in forestry.3 The evolution of the school's name and the breadth of its learning communities signal a clear commitment to addressing a wide spectrum of contemporary environmental challenges beyond traditional forestry.2 This dual focus positions YSE to train professionals and researchers capable of tackling complex issues like climate change and biodiversity loss from multiple angles.

However, the apparent lack of formal joint graduate degree programs between YSE and the primary AI/data science departments (CPSC, S\&DS) 14 suggests that students seeking deep, integrated expertise specifically at the intersection of advanced AI/ML and natural resources must forge their own interdisciplinary paths. While YSE provides foundational quantitative training (detailed in Section IV), accessing the advanced theoretical and methodological coursework concentrated in CPSC and S\&DS likely requires proactive planning and navigation of prerequisite structures outside the typical YSE curriculum. This underscores the importance of cross-departmental advising and potentially leveraging certificate programs or non-degree training to build the necessary computational skillset alongside environmental domain knowledge.

## **Curriculum and Training Opportunities**

Yale University offers a range of courses and training opportunities relevant to the application of AI, data science, and computational methods in natural resources and environmental science, distributed across YSE, CPSC, and S\&DS.

**A. Quantitative and Computational Training within YSE**

YSE provides foundational and applied training in quantitative methods directly relevant to environmental analysis and management. Key course areas include:

* **Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Remote Sensing:** Courses such as ENV 755 (Modeling Geographic Space) covering raster GIS, ENV 756 (Modeling Geographic Objects) focusing on vector GIS, ENV 704 (Workshop on Remote Sensing and Photogrammetry with Drones), and ENV 726 (Observing Earth from Space) equip students with essential spatial analysis skills.12 The Master of Forestry program, for instance, strongly recommends taking a GIS course.24  
* **Statistics and Data Analysis:** YSE offers introductory statistics tailored for environmental science using R (ENV 728/757), regression modeling (ENV 753), multivariate data analysis (ENV 758), and applied mathematics covering concepts like derivatives, linear algebra, and differential equations relevant to modeling (ENV 762).12 The MF program requires a course in measurement, such as regression or multivariate analysis.24  
* **Environmental Data Science and Modeling:** More specialized courses delve into data integration and machine learning in R (ENV 730), practical environmental data science using Python (ENV 617), data-driven techniques for specific domains like urban forestry (ENV 768\) 24, measuring and visualizing urban environments using diverse data sources (ENV 819), and capstone projects involving geospatial data and modeling for climate solutions (ENV 960).12

Student projects further illustrate the practical application of these skills, ranging from mapping sustainable farmlands in Panama using GIS 13 to developing sophisticated computer models mapping contaminant pathways from fracking sites 25 and using satellite data and ML models to enhance forest resilience.12

**B. AI, Data Science, and HPC Coursework in CPSC and S\&DS**

For students seeking more advanced theoretical grounding and cutting-edge techniques in AI, ML, and HPC, the Departments of Computer Science (CPSC) and Statistics & Data Science (S\&DS) offer extensive coursework:

Additionally, Yale fosters interdisciplinary learning through cross-divisional courses. Examples like "Topics in Critical Computing" (AMST/CPSC 2265\) and "AI, Medicine, and Society" (SOCY/BENG 2048a) bring together faculty from different schools (FAS, SEAS, YSM) to explore the societal, ethical, and practical dimensions of AI, potentially offering valuable perspectives for environmental applications concerning justice, health, or policy.38

**C. Accessibility of Advanced Computational Courses for Natural Resource Students**

Accessing intermediate and advanced AI/ML courses in CPSC and S\&DS typically requires a solid foundation in mathematics and computer science. Common prerequisites include 26:

* Calculus (often multivariable, e.g., MATH 120 or equivalent)  
* Linear Algebra (e.g., MATH 222/225/226 or CPSC 202/MATH 244\)  
* Introduction to Programming/Computer Science (e.g., CPSC 100/112/201)  
* Data Structures (e.g., CPSC 223\)  
* Probability and Statistical Theory (e.g., S\&DS 238/241 and often S\&DS 242 for more advanced S\&DS courses like S\&DS 365 33)  
* Introductory Machine Learning (e.g., S\&DS 265 for S\&DS 365 34)

YSE students aiming for deep AI/ML expertise must anticipate these requirements. While YSE provides applied math and introductory statistics/data science courses 12, students may need to take additional foundational coursework in mathematics (linear algebra, potentially more calculus) and computer science (data structures, discrete math) early in their graduate studies to meet the prerequisites for advanced CPSC or S\&DS offerings. This highlights the need for careful academic planning and advising for students pursuing this interdisciplinary trajectory.

**D. Specialized Certificates and Training Programs**

Beyond formal degree coursework, Yale offers other avenues for acquiring relevant skills:

* **Certificate in Data Science:** Offered by S\&DS, this certificate requires five course credits across probability/theory, methodology/analysis, computation/ML, and a domain application course.40 This could be a viable pathway for YSE students to gain structured data science training, provided they meet the prerequisites.  
* **YSE Online Certificates:** Programs like the Tropical Forest Landscapes Certificate provide practical tools and knowledge for conservation and restoration, incorporating social, ecological, and economic aspects, potentially including data analysis relevant to project planning and monitoring, though not explicitly focused on advanced AI/ML.42  
* **YCRC Training:** The Yale Center for Research Computing offers workshops on foundational skills (Python, R) and specific applications like AI/ML on HPC clusters, providing accessible, hands-on training opportunities for the Yale community.44  
* **Introductory Data Science Courses:** Courses like YData (S\&DS 123/S230E) are designed for students with little prior background and use Python, serving as potential entry points for building foundational computational and data literacy.35

**F. Implications**

The available curriculum across Yale clearly provides multiple pathways for students interested in computational environmental science. A tiered structure exists: YSE offers foundational and applied courses focusing on environmental data and problems 12, while CPSC and S\&DS provide the deeper theoretical and methodological training in advanced AI, ML, statistics, and computation.26 This structure allows students to tailor their training based on their career goals, whether focused on applying existing tools or developing novel computational methods for environmental challenges.

Successfully navigating this structure, however, requires deliberate planning, particularly for YSE students aiming for advanced computational expertise. The prerequisite chains for upper-level CPSC and S\&DS courses 33 necessitate foundational math and computer science knowledge that may extend beyond standard YSE requirements. Students must proactively identify and fulfill these prerequisites, possibly through coursework outside YSE or by leveraging resources like the Data Science Certificate 40 or introductory courses like YData.35 The availability of applied data science courses within YSE (e.g., ENV 617, ENV 730, ENV 768\) 12 and the activities of student groups like EDSY 51 signal a growing recognition of the importance of these skills within the environmental field itself, potentially easing the transition for students interested in more advanced computational work.

**E. Researcher and Student Access Policies**

Access to YCRC resources is managed through specific policies:

* **General Research Access:** Typically requires a Yale NetID and sponsorship by a Principal Investigator (PI). Account requests are submitted online and require PI (or designated delegate) approval.143  
* **Secure Cluster Access:** Clusters like Milgram and Hopper have stricter access controls. Hopper access, for example, is project-based, requires completion of specific training (HIPAA, NIST 800-171), annual renewal, regular PI review of users, connection via Yale VPN, and access through a Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) that restricts data transfer to the host machine.135 Milgram access requires justification for handling sensitive data.132  
* **Course Access:** Instructors can request cluster access for courses with computational components. Students and instructors receive temporary, course-specific accounts (e.g., courseid\_netid) with dedicated storage quotas and potentially reserved compute nodes. Access is typically via a course-specific OOD portal URL. These accounts and associated data are deleted approximately one month after the end of the semester, requiring students to proactively transfer any needed data to personal or research accounts.142

**F. Research Data Storage and Management**

YCRC provides cluster-associated storage, but users must be aware of its characteristics and limitations:

* **Storage Tiers:**  
  * /home/netid: Small quota (125GiB for course accounts), intended for scripts and configurations. **This is the only space routinely backed up**.145  
  * /project: Larger group-based quota (default 1TiB for courses), intended for active research data. Not backed up, but snapshots allow recovery from recent deletions/changes.145 Path is typically /gpfs/gibbs/project/....147  
  * /scratch60: Temporary storage for intermediate files; files older than 60 days are automatically deleted.147  
  * Purchased Storage: Groups can purchase dedicated long-term storage (minimum 10 TiB) on shared filesystems (/gpfs/gibbs/pi/ or /vast/palmer/pi/) for a 5-year term; this is not backed up.147  
* **Quotas:** Limits exist for both storage space (bytes) and the number of files. Users can check usage with getquota.134 Hitting quotas can cause job failures.147  
* **Best Practices:** Users are advised to stage large datasets from off-cluster storage, avoid creating vast numbers of small files (which strains the filesystem), compress data, and delete unneeded intermediate files.147  
* **Sensitive Data:** Only Milgram and the upcoming Hopper cluster are designated for storing sensitive data like PHI.132 Standard cluster storage (Grace, McCleary, Bouchet) is for low-risk data only.131  
* **Other Yale Storage:** Options like Google Drive (subject to new quotas 134), Storage@Yale, Teams/SharePoint, Dropbox, and Box exist but have varying costs, capabilities, and suitability for HPC workflows or sensitive data.134 The Storage Finder tool helps navigate options.134  
* **University Policy:** Yale Policy 6001 emphasizes proper data stewardship, management, retention, and sharing.149

**G. Implications**
